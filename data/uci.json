The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks.  However, the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape, or conformation, of the molecule.  Because bonds can rotate, a single molecule can adopt many different shapes.  To generate this data set, the low-energy conformations of the molecules were generated and then filtered to remove highly similar conformations. This left 476 conformations.  Then, a feature vector was extracted that describes each conformation.\n This many-to-one relationship between feature vectors and molecules is called the \"multiple instance problem\".

The tested gas classes (12 in total) formed a relatively broad combination of two analytes, acetone and ethanol, in binary mixtures. Both, raw data set and feature data set, are available. In particular, two sets of low-frequency and high-frequency features are provided for a comparison study.\n The primary data analysis is supposed to be a multivariate regression with multiple responses (two responses), where the predictors were the features extracted from the sensor signals and the responses were the concentrations of two analytes, acetone and ethanol. This task is also known as a mixture quantification problem of two analytes. Please see the article (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014, Section 3.2) for such regression analysis based on partial least squares (PLS). A classification task is also possible given that a small number of samples per class is available, if all the 12 classes are used. Another classification problem can be stated to distinguish two pure analytes and mixtures of them.\n Three concentrations doses 0.1, 0.3 and 1 vol.% were used to prepare the dilutions in water for the pure analytes. The same dilutions were used to generate gas mixtures. The gas classes included samples of pure ethanol ('lab' attribute eth-0.1, eth-0.3 and eth-1), samples of pure acetone (ace-0.1, ace-0.3 and ace-1), samples of binary mixtures of ethanol and acetone (ace-0.1-eth-0.1, ace-0.1-eth-0.3, ace-0.3-eth-0.1, ace-0.1-eth-1 and ace-1-eth-0.1) and samples of water dilutions without any analyte (air) giving a total number of 12 classes. The choice of these analytes and concentrations was not affected by any particular application constraint, except that the sensors of selected models show consistent and diverse responses among the gas classes. The statistics on class distribution among 58 samples:\n eth-0.1: 6\neth-0.3: 4\neth-1: 5\nace-0.1: 6\nace-0.3: 6\nace-1: 3\nace-0.1-eth-0.1: 4\nace-0.1-eth-0.3: 5\nace-0.3-eth-0.1: 5\nace-0.1-eth-1: 3\nace-1-eth-0.1: 3\nair: 8\n The measurements were split into 5 batches ('batch' attribute), where each batch contained records approximately for all gas classes given in a random order. All the batches were collected in a time period of 4 days to minimize the effect of the long-term internal and environmental noise in the system. The statistics on batch distribution among 58 samples:\n day-1-morning: 19\nday-2-afternoon: 10\nday-2-morning: 10\nday-3-morning: 11\nday-4-afternoon: 8\n The array was composed of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors of 5 different TGS models from Figaro Inc. The sensors were configured for 10 different sensor conditioning profiles based on the combination of 5 TGS models and 2 sensor operating temperatures. The circuit board with the gas sensor array was placed in a 70 ml inner volume chamber connected to the mechanical ventilator. The device of the mechanical ventilator was made commercially available from Harvard Apparatus (Harvard Apparatus, Harvard Inspira Advanced Safety Ventilator Manual, Tech. rep., 2003). The mechanical ventilator includes a cylinder of volume 63.44 cm3 and a mechanical pump that takes air from the outlet 'Source' and pushes the air sample through the outlet 'To Animal'. The system also receives the sample again in the outlet 'From Animal' to close the loop, control the air pressure decay, and collect the exhaled air. The cylinder of the ventilator was fixed to a frequency of 5 breaths per minute, approximately equivalent to 0.08 Hz for all the measurements. See the article (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014, Section 2.1) for a detailed description of the experimental set up.\n The measurement protocol was the following: using a micropipette we delivered 10 \u00ce\u00bcl of the corresponding dilution to the vessel, which in turn was connected to the apparatus 'Source' channel to expose the sensor array to the generated gas sample. After 3 min of exposition, the source of the gas vapour was removed from the vessel to start the recovery phase. During the recovery phase, the system was sampling room air for 2 additional minutes to record the decay in the sensors signals. The recorded time-series signal for each sensor was acquired at the sampling frequency of 25 Hz during 5 min, resulting in 7500 data points per time-series of a single sensor. Note that 2 minutes of recovery phase was not sufficient to recover the sensors baseline and re-establish again the initial conditions in the gas chamber. Hence, although we acquired 2 minutes of recovery phase, the system was pumping air until the sensors recovered the baseline and the whole gas sample was exhausted from the gas chamber.\n The readout data was the output voltage of the sensor stored as resistance values according to the voltage-divider scheme and using the value of the load resistor. Hence, each data point in the array described the resistance of a sensor R(t) at a certain time of measurement t. The resistance\nvalues in the data set were normalized by subtracting the baseline value R0 = R(t0) at the\nstarting point of the measurement t0 and scaling by factor R0, (R(t) \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 R0)/R0. Note that such format of the measured raw data allows for comparison of responses among different sensors.\n Previously to computing the low-frequency and high-frequency features, the raw data were pre-processed by a set of digital filters. A median filter was used to remove the spikes in the signals. Then we employed two Butterworth filters of 3rd order: a low-pass filter (cut-off frequency 0.01 Hz) and a high-pass filter (pass-frequency 0.07 Hz) to generate the low/high frequency signals, respectively. Note that these low/high frequency signals (output of the two Butterworth filters) are not distributed within the data set.\n For feature extraction, both low-frequency and high-frequency sensor signals were divided by respiratory cycles, where each cycle was processed independently. Thus, a feature is referred to as a feature by respiratory cycle. Since high-frequency signals showed oscillatory behavior similar to a sine wave curve, we decided to follow a straightforward strategy for feature extraction in this case. We used amplitude of the high-frequency signal (oscillation) at every respiratory cycle as a feature. Low-frequency trajectories had a monotonic behaviour, and we used the magnitude of the low-frequency signal as a feature at every respiratory cycle. The magnitude value was taken at the same time of oscillation, where the amplitude of the high-frequency signal was measured. Note that the low-frequency and high-frequency features were computed only for the first 13 respiration cycles.\n In addition to the low/high frequency features, we also introduced a cycle-independent feature per\nsingle measurement, defined as the maximum of the low-frequency signal over the course of\nthe measurement.\n The first data analysis of the data set was presented in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014), and the results reported there should be considered as a reference. The study aimed to characterize and explore the sensor signals in response to the modulated gas flow at a fixed respiration frequency. It was expected to confirm a superior performance of the proposed system under the gas flow modulation on the early detection scenario. The acquired modulated signals were decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components, and the resulted feature sets were compared in terms of the discrimination performance. Note that it was assumed that the low-frequency part of the modulated signals approximate the signals that would be measured under the standard constant flow rate mode (such assumption was empirically confirmed by observing the transient dynamics).\n The strategy in signal- and data-processing applied in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) was straightforward, and the analysis can be improved in a number of ways, on the stages of feature extraction and/or pattern recognition. Hence, the raw data stored in 'rawdata.csv.gz' file is intended for testing feature extraction methods, while the features computed in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) and stored in 'features.csv' can be readily used in testing pattern recognition methods.\n Additional links:\n1.

The raw data are stored in the first file 'rawdata.csv.gz', where each line represents a single measurement per sensor. Consequently, one needs to read specific 16 consecutive lines to get a single measurement from 16 sensors. The features extracted in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) are provided in the second file 'features.csv', where each line represents features extracted from all 16 time-series of the sensors (a single measurement).\n Raw data of each sample contains 16 time-series (one time-series per sensor). Each time-series was recorded during 5 min at a sample rate of 25 Hz (samples per second), providing 7500 data points per time-series. The total number of attributes per sample in raw data is 120000.\n Feature data set includes three types of features extracted from each time-series. Each time-series (one time-series per sensor) is associated with 1 maximum features, 13 high-frequency features and 13 low-frequency features (the features correspond to the first 13 respiration cycles, respectively).

computing. However, it is still very difficult for the mobile sensing community to compare state-of-art Indoor Positioning Systems due to the scarcity of publicly available databases. Magnetic field-based methods are becoming an important trend in this research field. Here, we present UJIIndoorLoc-Mag database, which can be used to compare magnetic field-based indoor localization methods. It consists of 270 continuous samples for training and 11 for testing. Each sample comprises a set of discrete captures taken along a corridor (or an intersection) with a period of 0.1 seconds. In total, there are almost 40.000 discrete captures, where each one contains features obtained from the magnetometer, the accelerometer and the orientation sensor of the device.\n Data has been stored as a simple text file as follows: \n ts_1\tmx_1\tmy_1\tmz_1\tax_1\tay_1\taz_1\tox_1\toy_1\toz_1\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nts_n\tmx_n\tmy_n\tmz_n\tax_n\tay_n\taz_n\tox_n\toy_n\toz_n\n lat_1\tlon_1\tlat_2\tlon_2\tFS_1\tLS_1\t\t\t\t\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nlat_m\tlon_m\tlat_m+1\tlon_m+1\tFS_m\tLS_m\t\t\t\t\n Where n is the number of samples collected in the trajectory at a 0.1 seconds frequency and m is the number of segments (corridors) in the trajectory. Each sample contains the timestamp ts and the values from magnetometer, accelerometer and orientation sensors in the three axes, which are denoted with mx, my, mz, ax, ay, az, ox, oy and oz. Finally, lat_i and lon_i corresponds to the coordinates (latitude & longitude in decimal degrees) of the initial, intermediate (intersections) and final points. A trajectory with m corridors has m+1 points. FS_i and LS_i state for the i-th trajectory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and last sample respectively in the full sequence of samples collected during the trajectory mapping. \n According to the previous structure, the text files are composed by two well-differentiated parts separated by the row indicating the number of segments in the trajectory: 1) the sequence of discrete samples taken during the trajectory mapping, and 2) the configuration data. \n The first part contains the timestamp (the UNIX time format in milliseconds) and the vector data from magnetometer (Android\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD), accelerometer (TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION) and orientation (TYPE_ORIENTATION) sensors. The accelerometer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values do not include the gravity force to have a better representation of user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real movement. \n The second part contains the information about location of initial, intermediate and ending points Moreover, the samples can be associated to corridor segments and, moreover, information about turnings is also provided in all the samples.\n The database consists of 281 continuous samples, 270 are for training and 11 for testing. They have been stored as independent text files. The training ones are grouped into two main categories \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lines\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153curves\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \n- The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lines\u00e2\u20ac\u009d group has 80 files and they stand for the single corridor case. The format for filename is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lXX_ZZ.txt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where XX stands for the number of corridor & orientation (n or r) and ZZ stands for repetition. Example: l3r_03.txt\n- The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153curves\u00e2\u20ac\u009d group has 190 files and they stand for all possible trajectories considering two connected corridors only. The format for that group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filename is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cXXYY_ZZ.txt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where XX and YY stand for the number of corridor & orientation for the first and second corridors in the two corridors trajectory, and ZZ stands for repetition.

Thus, unfair users can act maliciously towards others. The proposed solution enables to evaluate the trustworthiness of each user by monitoring the behavior of each other during their interaction on the network. These behaviors are represented by tuples including significant parameters. Based on these tuples, the architecture combines some artificial intelligence-based technologies to implement a decision making system.\nThe tuples are as follows:\neij =  where:\n eij - i-th entity interacting with j-th entity.\n EIDj - j-th entity Identification\n CT - Counting Trust. It is used to count how many trustworthy transactions (belonging to a specific context) occur after the last untrustworthy transaction.\nCU - Counting Un-trust.

It is used to take into account of the date at which the last experience in a specific context took place.\nTC - Transactions Context. It is used to identify the type of transaction, such as game, e-commerce, social network and others.\nTS - Trust Score. It  is the score that an entity gives to another entity at the end of each direct interaction.\n  The data set was obtained by a Java simulator which implemented the proposed architecture.\nIt includes data for the three most popular types of attack, namely:\n- Counting-based attack. The user tries to gain a good reputation by alternating the honest and dishonest behavior.\n- Time-based attack. User again tries to gain a good reputation by alternating the honest and dishonest behavior, but acts in different time.\n- Context-based attack. R tries to gain a good reputation by acting honestly for a type of transaction and dishonestly for another one.\n Because EIDj parameters are not relevant for the decision-making process, only the following parameters were reported in the dataset:\n- CT\n- CU\n- LT\n- TC\n- TS\n Because, there could be situation in which users have not historical data (tuples) for interacting with another one, it may get data (tuples) from third-parties who previously have had interaction with the inquired user.\nNevertheless, the trustworthiness of such third party entities (recommenders) needs to be evaluated also. Indeed, they may act through attacks, such as: Ballot Stuffing (BS), Bad mouthing , and Random opinion (RO).\nChanging of the TS parameter for a number of rows in the dataset, and in according to a specific attack, allows to obtain different datasets useful for the recommenders trustworthiness evaluation.\nAccording to this, the following datasets are also provided:\n- BM_x%.txt  x is the percentage of unfair recommendations obtained by a BM attack.

Primary o-ring erosion and/or blowby\n2. Primary o-ring erosion only\n The two databases are identical except for the 2nd attribute of the 21st instance (confirmed by David Draper on 8/5/93).\n Edited from (Draper, 1993):\n The motivation for collecting this database was the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986.  An investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.  The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field joints on one of the two solid booster rockets.  Each of these six field joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. \n The night before the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety.  The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops.  One other variable, the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks was performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was unclear.\n Draper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23 shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster.  No previous liftoff temperature was under 53 degrees F.  Although tremendous extrapolation must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F, it is obvious even to the layman \"to foresee the unacceptably high risk created by launching at 31 degrees F.\"  For more information, see Draper (1993) or the other previous analyses.\n The task is to predict the number of O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the launch temperature is below freezing.", "attrInformation": "     1.

Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=125), plus the crime variables which are potential dependent variables. The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders, Rape, Robbery, .... ), per capita (actually per 100,000 population) versions of each, and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes). \n A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.\n The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values). \n The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in missing values for per capita violent crime. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA (Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan have many of these).  \n The per capita nonviolent crime variable was calculated using the sum of crime variables considered non-violent crimes in the United States: burglaries, larcenies, auto thefts and arsons. (There are many other types of crimes, these only include FBI 'Index Crimes')\n Some further pre-processing of the dataset must be done. Choose the desirable dependent variable from among the 18 possible. It would not be interesting or appropriate to predict total crime (e.g. violent crime) while including subtotals (e.g. murders) as independent variables. There are also identifying variables (community name, county code, community code) that are not predictive, and would get in the way of some algorithms. Weka's Unsupervised Attribute Remove Filter can be used to remove unwanted attributes.\n The FBI notes that use of this data to evaluate communities is over-simplistic, as many relevant factors are not included. For one example, communities with large numbers of visitors will have higher per capita crime (measured by residents) than communities with fewer visitors, other things being equal.\n ", "attrInformation": "(125 predictive, 4 non-predictive, 18 potential goal)\n  -- communityname: Community name -

The first one contains the raw values of the measurements \nof all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). Sensor readings are sampled at a \nrate of 9 samples per second.\n The second one contains four sensor readings named 'simplified distances' and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). These simplified distances are referred to as the 'front distance', 'left distance', 'right distance' and 'back distance'. They consist, respectively, of the minimum sensor readings among those within 60 degree arcs located at the front, left, right and back parts of the robot.\n The third one contains only the front and left simplified distances and the corresponding class label.\n It is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step).\n The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. \n If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot succesfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network.\n Files with different number of sensor readings were built in order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with respect to the number of inputs.", "attrInformation": "Number of Attributes \n   -- sensor_readings_24.data: 24 numeric attributes and the class.\n   -- sensor_readings_4.data:   4 numeric attributes and the class.\n   -- sensor_readings_2.data:   2 numeric attributes and the class.\n   For Each Attribute: \n   -- File sensor_readings_24.data:\n\t1.

This could not be done from ground observatories because large portions of the infra-red spectrum is absorbed by the atmosphere.  The primary observing program was the full high resolution sky mapping performed by scanning at 4 frequencies. The Low Resolution Observation (IRAS-LRS) program observed high intensity sources over two continuous spectral bands.  This database derives from a subset of the higher quality LRS observations taken between 12h and 24h right ascension. \n This database contains 531 high quality spectra derived from the IRAS-LRS database.  The original data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands.  Of these, 44 blue band and 49 red band channels contain usable flux measurements.  Only these are included here.  The original spectral intensities values are compressed to 4-digits, and each spectrum includes 5 rescaling parameters.  We have used the LRS specified algorithm to rescale these to units of spectral intensity (Janskys).  Total intensity differences have been eliminated by normalizing each spectrum to a mean value of 5000.\n This database was originally obtained for use in development and testing of our AutoClass system for Bayesian classification.  We have not retained any results from this development, having concentrated our efforts of a 5425 element version of the same data.  Our classifications were based upon simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. With the larger database we were able to find classes that correspond well with known spectral types associated with particular stellar types. We also found classes that match with the spectra expected of certain stellar processes under investigation by Ames astronomers.  These classes have considerably enlarged the set of stars being investigated by those researchers.  \n Original Data:\n The original fortran data file is given in spectra-2.data.

However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. \n  The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.\n   Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range  0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of  0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.\n   The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to  0.00)).\n   However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)\n   A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.\n .arff header for Weka:\n @relation crimepredict\n @attribute state numeric\n@attribute county numeric\n@attribute community numeric\n@attribute communityname string\n@attribute fold numeric\n@attribute population numeric\n@attribute householdsize numeric\n@attribute racepctblack numeric\n@attribute racePctWhite numeric\n@attribute racePctAsian numeric\n@attribute racePctHisp numeric\n@attribute agePct12t21 numeric\n@attribute agePct12t29 numeric\n@attribute agePct16t24 numeric\n@attribute agePct65up numeric\n@attribute numbUrban numeric\n@attribute pctUrban numeric\n@attribute medIncome numeric\n@attribute pctWWage numeric\n@attribute pctWFarmSelf numeric\n@attribute pctWInvInc numeric\n@attribute pctWSocSec numeric\n@attribute pctWPubAsst numeric\n@attribute pctWRetire numeric\n@attribute medFamInc numeric\n@attribute perCapInc numeric\n@attribute whitePerCap numeric\n@attribute blackPerCap numeric\n@attribute indianPerCap numeric\n@attribute AsianPerCap numeric\n@attribute OtherPerCap numeric\n@attribute HispPerCap numeric\n@attribute NumUnderPov numeric\n@attribute PctPopUnderPov numeric\n@attribute PctLess9thGrade numeric\n@attribute PctNotHSGrad numeric\n@attribute PctBSorMore numeric\n@attribute PctUnemployed numeric\n@attribute PctEmploy numeric\n@attribute PctEmplManu numeric\n@attribute PctEmplProfServ numeric\n@attribute PctOccupManu numeric\n@attribute PctOccupMgmtProf numeric\n@attribute MalePctDivorce numeric\n@attribute MalePctNevMarr numeric\n@attribute FemalePctDiv numeric\n@attribute TotalPctDiv numeric\n@attribute PersPerFam numeric\n@attribute PctFam2Par numeric\n@attribute PctKids2Par numeric\n@attribute PctYoungKids2Par numeric\n@attribute PctTeen2Par numeric\n@attribute PctWorkMomYoungKids numeric\n@attribute PctWorkMom numeric\n@attribute NumIlleg numeric\n@attribute PctIlleg numeric\n@attribute NumImmig numeric\n@attribute PctImmigRecent numeric\n@attribute PctImmigRec5 numeric\n@attribute PctImmigRec8 numeric\n@attribute PctImmigRec10 numeric\n@attribute PctRecentImmig numeric\n@attribute PctRecImmig5 numeric\n@attribute PctRecImmig8 numeric\n@attribute PctRecImmig10 numeric\n@attribute PctSpeakEnglOnly numeric\n@attribute PctNotSpeakEnglWell numeric\n@attribute PctLargHouseFam numeric\n@attribute PctLargHouseOccup numeric\n@attribute PersPerOccupHous numeric\n@attribute PersPerOwnOccHous numeric\n@attribute PersPerRentOccHous numeric\n@attribute PctPersOwnOccup numeric\n@attribute PctPersDenseHous numeric\n@attribute PctHousLess3BR numeric\n@attribute MedNumBR numeric\n@attribute HousVacant numeric\n@attribute PctHousOccup numeric\n@attribute PctHousOwnOcc numeric\n@attribute PctVacantBoarded numeric\n@attribute PctVacMore6Mos numeric\n@attribute MedYrHousBuilt numeric\n@attribute PctHousNoPhone numeric\n@attribute PctWOFullPlumb numeric\n@attribute OwnOccLowQuart numeric\n@attribute OwnOccMedVal numeric\n@attribute OwnOccHiQuart numeric\n@attribute RentLowQ numeric\n@attribute RentMedian numeric\n@attribute RentHighQ numeric\n@attribute MedRent numeric\n@attribute MedRentPctHousInc numeric\n@attribute MedOwnCostPctInc numeric\n@attribute MedOwnCostPctIncNoMtg numeric\n@attribute NumInShelters numeric\n@attribute NumStreet numeric\n@attribute PctForeignBorn numeric\n@attribute PctBornSameState numeric\n@attribute PctSameHouse85 numeric\n@attribute PctSameCity85 numeric\n@attribute PctSameState85 numeric\n@attribute LemasSwornFT numeric\n@attribute LemasSwFTPerPop numeric\n@attribute LemasSwFTFieldOps numeric\n@attribute LemasSwFTFieldPerPop numeric\n@attribute LemasTotalReq numeric\n@attribute LemasTotReqPerPop numeric\n@attribute PolicReqPerOffic numeric\n@attribute PolicPerPop numeric\n@attribute RacialMatchCommPol numeric\n@attribute PctPolicWhite numeric\n@attribute PctPolicBlack numeric\n@attribute PctPolicHisp numeric\n@attribute PctPolicAsian numeric\n@attribute PctPolicMinor numeric\n@attribute OfficAssgnDrugUnits numeric\n@attribute NumKindsDrugsSeiz numeric\n@attribute PolicAveOTWorked numeric\n@attribute LandArea numeric\n@attribute PopDens numeric\n@attribute PctUsePubTrans numeric\n@attribute PolicCars numeric\n@attribute PolicOperBudg numeric\n@attribute LemasPctPolicOnPatr numeric\n@attribute LemasGangUnitDeploy numeric\n@attribute LemasPctOfficDrugUn numeric\n@attribute PolicBudgPerPop numeric\n@attribute ViolentCrimesPerPop numeric\n @data\n  ", "attrInformation": "Attribute Information: (122 predictive, 5 non-predictive, 1 goal)\n  -- state: US state (by number) -

The binary values\n     were converted to their present ASCII form by Ashwin Srinivasan.\n     The classification for each pixel was performed on the basis of\n     an actual site visit by Ms. Karen Hall, when working for Professor\n     John A. Richards, at the Centre for Remote Sensing at the University\n     of New South Wales, Australia. Conversion to 3x3 neighbourhoods and\n     splitting into test and training sets was done by Alistair Sutherland.\n", "information": "The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.\n The Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.\n One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.\n The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:\n Number\t\t\tClass\n1\t\t\tred soil\n2\t\t\tcotton crop\n3\t\t\tgrey soil\n4\t\t\tdamp grey soil\n5\t\t\tsoil with vegetation stubble\n6\t\t\tmixture class (all types present)\n7\t\t\tvery damp grey soil\n NB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.\n The data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.\n In each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary.\n", "attrInformation": "The attributes are numerical, in the range 0 to 255.", "image": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/assets/MLimages/Large146.jpg"}, {"link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Audiology+%28Standardized%29", "datasetFolder": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/audiology/", "datasetDescription": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/audiology/audiology.standardized.names", "title": "Audiology (Standardized) Data Set", "dsFeatures": "Multivariate", "numberObs": "226", "area": "Life", "atributeType": "Categorical", "numberAttr": "69", "dateDonated": "1992-08-18", "missingValues": "Yes", "numberWebHits": "92520", "abstract": "Standardized version of the original audiology database", "source": "Original Version:\n     (a) Original Owner: Professor Jergen at Baylor College of Medicine\n    (b) Donor: Bruce Porter (porter '@' fall.cs.utexas.EDU)\n Standardized Version:\n     (a) Donor: Ross Quinlan", "information": "This database is a standardized version of the original audiology database (see audiology.* in this directory).

Please contact info '@' zzalpha.com if you desire to purchase the set of the certified .pdf, .p7s file pairs.  The certified set contains only the recommendations, not the results included in the deposited set here.\nFor convenience, the data deposited includes calculated returns (outcomes) for each recommended transaction.  The returns obviously were not part of the original recommendations when made, but were appended later.  Returns were calculated several days after sale day.\nThe date inside the file reflects the date for which morning trading recommendation was made.  The evaluation of the recommendations, as described in the KDD 2015 article mentioned above, involved comparison of the opening price of the day of recommendation to the opening price five market days later.  As mentioned in the article, evaluation must be adjusted by trading costs and constraints.\nA recommendation portfolio consists of a segment, a size (1,2,5,10,20), and a side (Long or Short),  and the ticker symbols of the companies recommended for price increase (or decrease in the case of Short) from the opening price to the opening price 5 trading days later.\nThe stocks included must first pass a general screen of $3 recent price and 80,000 recent daily average share volume for inclusion.  Thus penny stocks and micro-caps are not present and even some large cap, but very low prices stocks are omitted.  All stocks must be traded on NYSE, NASDAQ or AMEX at the time of recommendation.\nThe daily file contains all recommendations for all portfolios for the day.

The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.The dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Being completely operated by a fully computerized environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201dcontrolled by a LabVIEW\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNational Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. See Tables 1 and 2 of the below cited manuscript for details on the gas identity name, concentration values, and time distribution sequence of the measurement recordings considered in this dataset.Batch10.dat was updated on 10/14/2013 to correct some corrupted values in the last 120 lines of the file.An extension of this dataset with the concentration values is available at Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations Data Set [Web Link]", "attrInformation": "The response of the said sensors is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor; hence each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each of which represented by an aggregate of features reflecting all the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: (i) The so-called steady-state feature (\u00ce\u201dR), defined as the difference of the maximal resistance change and the baseline and its normalized version expressed by the ratio of the maximal resistance and the baseline values when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber. And (ii), an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement procedure under controlled conditions, namely the exponential moving average (ema\u00ce\u00b1). These aggregate of features is a transform, borrowed from the field of econometrics originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the said transient portion into a real scalar,  by estimating the maximum value \u00e2\u20ac\u201dminimum for the decaying portion of the sensor response\u00e2\u20ac\u201d of its exponential moving average (ema\u00ce\u00b1), with an initial condition set to zero and a scalar smoothing parameter of the operator, \u00ce\u00b1, that defines both the quality of the feature and the time of its occurrence along the time series the scalar, set to range between 0 and 1. In particular, three different values for \u00ce\u00b1 were set to obtain three different feature values from the pre-recorded rising portion of the sensor response  and three additional features with the same \u00ce\u00b1 values but for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. For a more detailed analysis and discussion on these features as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to Section 2.3 and Figure 2, respectively of the annotated manuscript.Once the abovementioned features are calculated, one is to form a feature vector containing the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor multiplied by the 16 sensors considered here. In the end, the resulting 128-dimensional feature vector containing all the features indicated above (8 features \u00c3\u2014 16 sensors) is organized as follows:\u00ce\u201dR_1, |\u00ce\u201dR|_1, EMAi0.001_1, EMAi0.01_1, EMAi0.1_1, EMAd0.001_1, EMAd0.01_1, EMAd0.1_1, \u00ce\u201dR_2, |\u00ce\u201dR|_2, EMAi0.001_2, EMAi0.01_2, EMAi0.1_2, EMAd0.001_2, EMAd0.01_2, EMAd0.1_2,..., \u00ce\u201dR_16, |\u00ce\u201dR|_16, EMAi0.001_16, EMAi0.01_16, EMAi0.1_16, EMAd0.001_16, EMAd0.01_16, EMAd0.1_16,where: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00ce\u201dR_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153|\u00ce\u201dR|_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the \u00ce\u201dR and the normalized \u00ce\u201dR feature, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.001_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.01_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.1_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.001_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.01_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.1_1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, all corresponding to sensor # 1; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00ce\u201dR_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153|\u00ce\u201dR|_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the \u00ce\u201dR and the normalized \u00ce\u201dR feature, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.001_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.01_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAi0.1_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.001_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.01_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153EMAd0.1_2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the ema\u00ce\u00b1 of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for \u00ce\u00b1 equals to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively, all corresponding to sensor # 2; and so forth up until sensor # 16, forming thus the 128-dimensional feature vector that is to be fetched to the classifiers for training.For processing purposes, the data is organized into ten batches, each containing the number of measurements per class and month indicated in the table below. This reorganization of data was done to ensure having a sufficient and as uniformly distributed as possible number of experiments in each class and month when training the classifier.Dataset organization details. Each row corresponds to months that were combined to form a batch:Batch ID\tMonth IDsBatch 1\t        Months 1 and 2Batch 2\t        Months 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10Batch 3\t        Months 11, 12, and 13Batch 4\t        Months 14 and 15Batch 5\t        Month 16Batch 6\t        Months 17, 18, 19, and 20Batch 7\t        Month 21Batch 8\t        Months 22 and 23Batch 9\t        Months 24 and 30Batch 10\tMonth 36The data format follows the same coding style as in libsvm, in which one indicates the class each data point belongs to (1: Ethanol; 2: Ethylene; 3:Ammonia; 4: Acetaldehyde; 5: Acetone; 6: Toluene), and, then, the collection of features in a format x:v, where x stands for the feature number and v for the actual value of the feature. For example, in 1 1:15596.162100 2:1.868245 3:2.371604 4:2.803678 5:7.512213 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 128:-2.654529 The number \u00e2\u20ac\u01531\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stands for the class number (in this case Ethanol), whereas the remaining 128 columns list the actual feature values for each measurement recording organized as described above.

The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)\n This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a \"hybrid\" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.

In particular, we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption. \n The data set was collected in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner. \n The sensor array included 16 chemical sensors (Figaro Inc., US) of 4 different types: TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2610, TGS-2620 (4 units of each type). The sensors were integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. The operating voltage of the sensors, which controls the sensors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operating temperature, was kept constant at 5 V for the whole duration of the experiments. The sensors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conductivities were acquired continuously at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The sensor array was placed in a 60 ml measurement chamber, where the gas sample was injected at a constant flow of 300 ml/min.\n Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals while concentration levels changed randomly. For each measurement (each gas mixture), the signals were acquired continuously for about 12 hours without interruption. \n The concentration transitions were set at random times (in the interval 80-120s) and to random concentration levels. The data set was constructed such that all possible transitions are present: increasing, decreasing, or setting to zero the concentration of one volatile while the concentration of the other volatile is kept constant (either at a fixed or at zero concentration level). At the beginning, ending, and approximately every 10,000 s, we inserted additional predefined concentration patterns with pure gas mixtures.\n The concentration ranges for Ethylene, Methane, and CO were selected such that the induced magnitudes of the sensor responses were similar. Moreover, for gas mixtures, lower concentration levels were favored. Therefore, the multivariate response of the sensors to the presented set of stimuli is challenging since none of the configurations (single\ngas or mixture presentation) can be easily identified from the magnitude of sensors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 responses. In particular Ethylene concentration ranges from 0-20 ppm; 0-600 ppm for CO; and 0-300 ppm for Methane.\n The primary purpose of making this data set freely accessible on-line is to provide extensive and continuous time series acquired from chemical sensors to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks. In particular, the data set may be useful to develop algorithms for continuous monitoring or improve response time of sensory systems. Also, the repetition of the same type of sensors in the array will allow further investigation on sensor variability (reproducibility of sensors of the same kind). Other interesting topics may include sensor failure (to what extent system predictions degrade when sensors start failing) or calibration transfer (whether the model for one sensor can be extended to other sensors).\n More information on the generated data set can be found in Fonollosa et al.

Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\n Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\n The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in:\n    D.

In the real data, the h class represents the majority of the events.\n    The simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers an ROC curve has to be used. The relevant points on this curve are those, where the probability of accepting a background event as signal is below one of the following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 depending on the required quality of the sample of the accepted events for different experiments.", "image": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/assets/MLimages/Large159.jpg"}, {"link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires", "datasetFolder": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/", "datasetDescription": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/forestfires.names", "title": "Forest Fires Data Set", "dsFeatures": "Multivariate", "numberObs": "517", "area": "Physical", "atributeType": "Real", "numberAttr": "13", "dateDonated": "2008-02-29", "missingValues": "N/A", "numberWebHits": "738593", "abstract": "This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data (see details at", "source": "Paulo Cortez, pcortez '@' dsi.uminho.pt, Department of Information Systems, University of Minho, Portugal.\nAn\u00edbal Morais, araimorais '@' gmail.com, Department of Information Systems, University of Minho, Portugal.

For safety\n   precaution issues, boxing hand wraps have been given to the subjects, and for the warm up the subjects\n   were instructed to familiarise with the bag by having a number of trial runs. The subjects were aware that\n   since their involvement in this series of experiments was voluntary, it was made clear that they could\n   withdraw at any time from the study.\n 2. Instrumentation:\n   The Essex robotic arena was the main experimental hall where the data collection took place.

For the\n   normal actions, a human partner has been used as a focus target attracting the attention from the subjects\n   so as to perform more realistic activity. For the aggressive actions, the subjects made use of a professional\n   kick-boxing standing bag, 1.75m tall, with a human figure drawn on its body.

The total number of samples in the dataset is 8235 ( = 45 \u00c3\u2014 183 ).\n The handwriting samples were collected on an iball 8060U external digitizing tablet connected to a laptop using its cordless digital stylus pen. The data acquisition program consists of a GUI which shows a box on the screen along with other controls. The writers are instructed to write only inside the acquisition box. The acquisition program records the handwriting as a stream of (X, Y) coordinate points using the appropriate pen position sensor along with the pen-up/pen-down switching.

The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind, followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind, but also have all the other properties required for a drug (solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, toxicity, etc.). \nThe original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge. In particular, we added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power.

It also contains the ground truth collected from both expert image inspection and histology (in an xlsx file). There are features vectors for 76 lesions, and there are 3 types of lesion: hyperplasic, adenoma and serrated adenoma. It is possible to consider this classification problem as a binary one by combining adenoma and serrated adenoma in the same class. According to this, hyperplasic lesions would belong to the class 'benign' while the other two types of gastrointestinal lesions would go to the 'malignant' class. \n The first line/row of the dataset corresponds to the lesion name (text label). Every lesion appears twice because it has been recorded using two types of lights: white light (WL) and narrow band imaging (NBI). The second line/row represents the type of lesion (3 for adenoma, 1 for hyperplasic, and 2 for serrated). And, finally, the third line/row is the type of light used (1 for WL and 2 for NBI). All other rows are the raw features (without any kind of preprocessing):\n422 2D TEXTURAL FEATURES\n- First 166 features: AHT: Autocorrelation Homogeneous Texture (Invariant Gabor Texture)\n- Next 256: Rotational Invariant LBP\n76 2D COLOR FEATURES\n- 16 Color Naming\n- 13 Discriminative Color\n- 7 Hue\n- 7 Opponent\n- 33 color gray-level co-occurrence matrix\n200 3D SHAPE FEATURES\n- 100 shapeDNA\n- 100 KPCA\n The main objective of this dataset is to study how good computers can be at diagnosing gastrointestinal lesions from regular colonoscopic videos. In order to compare the performance of machine learning methods with the one offered by humans, we provide the file ground_truth.xlsx that includes the ground truth after histopathology and the opinion of 7 clinicians (4 experts and 3 beginners). An automatic tissue classification approach could save clinician's time by avoiding chromoendoscopy, a time-consuming staining procedure using indigo carmine, as well as could help to assess the severity of individual lesions in patients with many polyps, so that the gastroenterologist would directly focus on those requiring polypectomy. A possible way of proceeding with the classification is to concatenate the information from the two types of light for each lesion, i.e. create a single vector of 1396 elements per lesion.\n The technical goal is to maximize accuracy while minimizing false positives (lesions that do not need resection but that are classified as if they do) and false negatives (lesions that do need resection but that are classified as if they do not need it). In particular, we are specially interested on maximizing accuracy while reducing false negatives, i.e. minimizing the number of adenoma and serrated adenoma that are classified as hyperplasic. The opposite case is not that serious: the resection of a hyperplasic polyp considering it as an adenoma or serrated adenoma. Another interesting experiment would consist on compare the performance of the best machine learning method we can get with the one provided by human operators (experts and beginners).\n The best results obtained so far, in the binary case, using leave-one-out and Random Forest with 1000 trees (using color+texture+3D with NBI), corresponded to an accuracy of ~89,5%, sensitivity ~94,5% and specificity ~76% (considering as positive condition the resection).

Relevant Information:\n   -- Introduction\n     The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania \n     trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the \n     Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised \n     air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, \n     such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' \n     positive class consists of component failures \n     for a specific component of the APS system. \n     The negative class consists of trucks with failures \n     for components not related to the APS. The data consists \n     of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. \n    -- Challenge metric  \n      Cost-metric of miss-classification:\n      Predicted class |      True class       |\n                     |    pos    |    neg    |\n     -----------------------------------------\n      pos            |     -     |  Cost_1   |\n     -----------------------------------------\n      neg            |  Cost_2   |     -     |\n     -----------------------------------------\n     Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500\n      The total cost of a prediction model the sum of 'Cost_1' \n     multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure \n     and 'Cost_2' with the number of instances with type 2 failure, \n     resulting in a 'Total_cost'.\n      In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary \n     check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while \n     Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, \n     which may cause a breakdown.\n      Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.\n 5. Number of Instances: \n     The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which \n     59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. \n     The test set contains 16000 examples. \n 6. Number of Attributes: 171 \n 7. Attribute Information:\n   The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for \n   proprietary reasons.

For example\n data/H3K9me3_TDH_BP/samples/tcell/ERS358697/problems/chr8:48135599-86500000/coverage.bedGraph.gz\n represents a vector defined on all genomic positions from 48135600 to\n86500000 on chr8 (for a particular tcell sample named ERS358697, in\nthe H3K9me3_TDH_BP data set). To save disk space the vectors are saved\nusing a run-length encoding; for example the first three lines of this\nfile are\n chr8\t48135599\t48135625\t0\nchr8\t48135625\t48135629\t1\nchr8\t48135629\t48135632\t2\n which mean that the first 26 entries of the vector are 0, the next\nfour entries are 1, and the following three entries are 2. Note that\nstart positions are 0-based but end positions are 1-based, so the\nfirst line means a 0 from all positions from 48135600 to 48135625\n(excluding the start position 48135599 for which we have no\ninformation).\n The goal is to learn a function that takes the coverage.bedGraph.gz\nfile as input, and outputs a binary classification for every genomic\nposition. The positive class represents peaks (typically large counts)\nand the negative class represents background noise (typically small\ncounts).\n Weak labels are given in labels.bed files, each of which indicates\nseveral regions of the genome with or without peaks. For example the\nfile\n data/H3K4me3_XJ_immune/samples/bcell/McGill0091/problems/chr1:30028082-103863906/labels.bed\n contains the 6 labels below:\n chr1\t33111786\t33114894\tnoPeaks\nchr1\t33114941\t33116174\tpeakStart\nchr1\t33116183\t33116620\tpeakEnd\nchr1\t33116633\t33116755\tnoPeaks\nchr1\t33116834\t33118135\tpeaks\nchr1\t33118161\t33120163\tnoPeaks\n The four labels are interpreted as follows:\n noPeaks: all of the predictions in this region should be negative /\nbackground noise. For example the first line in the file above means\nthat for a vector x_i of count data from i=30028083 to i=103863906,\nthe desired function should predict negative / background noise\nf(x_i)=0 from i=33111787 to i=33114894. If positive / peaks are\npredicted f(x_i)=1 for any i in this region, that is counted as a\nfalse positive label.\n peakStart: there should be exactly one peak start predicted in this\nregion. A peak start is defined as a position i such that a peak is\npredicted there f(x_i)=1 but not at the previous position\nf(x_{i-1})=0. The exact position is unspecified; any position is fine,\nas long as there is only one start in the region. Predicting exactly\none peak start in this region results in a true positive. More starts\nis a false positive, and fewer starts is a false negative. For\nexample,\n  [peakStart] \n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 -> correct.  \n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 -> also correct.  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -> false negative (no peak starts).\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 -> flase positive (two peak starts).\n peakEnd: there should be exactly one peak end predicted in this\nregion. A peak end is defined as a position i such that a peak is\npredicted there f(x_i)=1 but not at the next position f(x_{i+1})=0.\nThe exact position is unspecified; any position is fine, as long as\nthere is only one end in the region. Predicting exactly one peak end\nin this region results in a true positive. More ends is a false\npositive, and fewer ends is a false negative. For example,\n  [ peakEnd ] \n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 -> correct.  \n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 -> also correct.  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -> false negative (no peak ends).\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 -> flase positive (two peak ends).\n peaks: there should be at least one peak predicted somewhere in this\nregion (anywhere is fine). Zero predicted peaks in this region is a\nfalse negative. If there is a predicted peak somewhere in this region\nthat is a true positive.\n For a particular set of predicted peaks f(x), the total number of\nincorrect labels (false positives + false negatives) can be computed\nas an evaluation metric (smaller is better). Typically the peak\npredictions are also stored using a run-length encoding; the error\nrates can be computed using the reference implementation in R package\nPeakError, [Web Link]  Receiver Operating Characteristic curves can be computed for a family\nof predicted peaks f_lambda(x), where lambda is some significance\nthreshold, intercept parameter, etc. Compute the TPR and FPR as follows:\n TPR = (total number of true positives)/(total number of labels that could have a true positive)\n = (number of correct peaks, peakStart, peakEnd labels)/(number of peaks, peakStart, peakEnd labels)\n FPR = (total number of false positives)/(total number of labels that could have a false positive)\n = (\nnumber of peakStart/End labels with two or more predicted starts/end + \nnumber of noPeaks labels with predicted peaks\n)/(number of peakStart, peakEnd, and noPeaks labels)\n Suggested fold ID numbers for four-fold cross-validation experiments\ncan be found in data/*/folds.csv files. For example\ndata/H3K36me3_TDH_[Web Link] contains\n problem,fold\nchr16:8686921-32000000,1\nchr16:60000-8636921,1\nchr21:43005559-44632664,2\nchr14:19050000-107289540,3\nchr15:29209443-77800000,4\n which means that problems chr16:8686921-32000000 and\nchr16:60000-8636921 should be considered fold ID 1,\nchr21:43005559-44632664 should be considered fold ID 2, etc. This\nmeans that for data set H3K36me3_TDH_other, the fold ID 2 consists of\nall data in\ndata/H3K36me3_TDH_other/samples/*/*/problems/chr21:43005559-44632664\ndirectories.\n There are several types of learning settings that could be used with\nthese data. Here are four examples.\n Unsupervised learning. Train models only using the\ncoverage.bedGraph.gz files. Only use the labels for evaluation (not\nfor training model parameters).\n Supervised learning. Train models only using the coverage.bedGraph.gz\nand labels.bed files in the train set. Use the labels in the test set\nto evaluate prediction accuracy.\n Semi-supervised learning. Train models using the coverage.bedGraph.gz\nand labels.bed files in the train set. You can additionally use the\ncoverage.bedGraph.gz files in the test set at training time. Use the\nlabels in the test set to evaluate prediction accuracy.\n Multi-task learning. Many data sets come from different experiment\ntypes, so have different peak patterns. For example H3K4me3_TDH_immune\nis a H3K4me3 histone modification (sharp peak pattern) and\nH3K36me3_TDH_immune is a H3K36me3 histone modification (broad peak\npattern). Therefore it is not expected that models should generalize\nbetween data sets. However there is something common across data sets\nin that in each data set, the peak / positive class is large values,\nwheras the noise / negative class is small values. Therefore\nmulti-task learning may be interesting. To compare a multi-task\nlearning model to a single-task learning model, use the suggested\ncross-validation fold IDs. For test fold ID 1, train both the\nmulti-task and single-task learning models using all other folds, then\nmake predictions on all data with fold ID 1. \n", "attrInformation": "Each attribute is a non-negative integer representing the number DNA sequence reads that has aligned at that particular region of the genome.

The waves with the frequency of  7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 13 Hz over motor processing areas are called mu rhythm and reflect idling activity in motor areas. It is more pronounced when the subjects are at rest and at least a second before subjects initiate voluntary movement, the mu  activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the region moved shows a decrease in amplitude and is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD).\nFor the current study, EEG data was collected for 5 times on various days from a healthy right-handed subject of 25 years of age. The data was recorded on a Medelec Profile Digital EEG machine. The settings of high frequency filter 50 Hz, low frequency filter 1.6 Hz, notch filter 50 Hz, sensitivity 70 micro volts/mm, and a sampling rate of 256 Hz were used for the basic signal processing.\n Eight EEG electrodes (C3, C4, P3, P4, F3, F4, T3, and T4) were placed according to the international standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. Bipolar and unipolar EEG was recorded from eight Ag/AgCI scalp electrodes, which were placed 2.5 cm anterior and posterior to the central electrodes C3 and C4 (left and right side of the hemisphere). A1 and A2 are reference electrodes. The reference electrodes are placed on the left and right ears and the ground electrode on the forehead. EOG (Electrooculogram) being a noise artifact, was derived from two electrodes, placed on the outer cantus of left and right eye in order to detect eye movement. These EOG signals are then used to eliminate eye movement artifacts. \nThe subject was asked to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with eyes closed and advised to minimize eye movements. The EEG was recorded for the relaxed state for 5 minutes. Following this, an audio beep of 60 db and 0.91 sec. duration was given at the start and end of a 5 second epoch where the subject was asked to mentally plan lifting of the right hand thumb.

After a gap of 5 minutes, the same cue is given to repeat the experiment. The whole experiment lasts for approximately 30 minutes, collecting data for 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for normal relaxed state and 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for movement imagery.

The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.  \n HISTORY:\n This data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.\n This object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\n The rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.\n  DESCRIPTION:\n The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.\n Four \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\n The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\n The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\n  A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.\n", "attrInformation": "ATTRIBUTES\n \tCOMPACTNESS\t(average perim)**2/area\n \tCIRCULARITY\t(average radius)**2/area\n \tDISTANCE CIRCULARITY\tarea/(av.distance from border)**2\n \tRADIUS RATIO\t(max.rad-min.rad)/av.radius\n \tPR.AXIS ASPECT RATIO\t(minor axis)/(major axis)\n \tMAX.LENGTH ASPECT RATIO\t(length perp. max length)/(max length)\n \tSCATTER RATIO\t(inertia about minor axis)/(inertia about major axis)\n \tELONGATEDNESS\t\tarea/(shrink width)**2\n \tPR.AXIS RECTANGULARITY\tarea/(pr.axis length*pr.axis width)\n \tMAX.LENGTH RECTANGULARITY area/(max.length*length perp. to this)\n \tSCALED VARIANCE \t(2nd order moment about minor axis)/area\n\tALONG MAJOR AXIS\n \tSCALED VARIANCE \t(2nd order moment about major axis)/area\n\tALONG MINOR AXIS \n \tSCALED RADIUS OF GYRATION\t(mavar+mivar)/area\n \tSKEWNESS ABOUT \t(3rd order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**3\n\tMAJOR AXIS\n \tSKEWNESS ABOUT \t(3rd order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**3\n\tMINOR AXIS\n \tKURTOSIS ABOUT \t(4th order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**4\n\tMINOR AXIS  \n \tKURTOSIS ABOUT \t(4th order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**4\n\tMAJOR AXIS\n \tHOLLOWS RATIO\t(area of hollows)/(area of bounding polygon)\n \t Where sigma_maj**2 is the variance along the major axis and sigma_min**2 is the variance along the minor axis, and\n \tarea of hollows= area of bounding poly-area of object \n \t The area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of the computation to find the maximum length.

Each cylinder is itself described by 9 attributes: location x 3, axis x 3, height, radius, and texture.  This code generates instances in one of four classes: dogs, cats, horses, and giraffes.  The program generates instances by selecting a class according to a distribution determined by function rand4().  Each class has a prototype; the prototype of the selected class is perturbed according to a distribution described in the code for the four classes (i.e., parameterized means with Guassian distributions are used to represent prototypes and perturbation distributions, where the means are used to distinguish the four classes).\n From John Gennari: (1990)\n The only notes I have about it is that I don't use the data format it creates any more.

The database was measured under a stationary scenario where there were no movements around the Tx/Rx at the time of measurements. This is achieved since the survey is conducted during low-activity time. This gives a total of 1960 samples because each point has 10 measurements. \n In the case of Lab139 there is one set of measurements where the furthest point between the Tx/Rx is 7.1m and then the  receiver will moved across the uniform grid. This gives a total of 1960 points.\n In the case of Corridor_rm155 there are three set of measurements where the furthest point between Tx/Rx is 7.1m and this gives a total of 1960 points.\n In the case of Main_Lobby there are three set of measurements where the furthest point between Tx/Rx is 7.1m  and this gives a total of 1960 points.\n In the case of Sport_Hall there is one set of measurements where the furthest point between the Tx/Rx is 7.1m and this gives a total of 1960 points.\n filename format (environment_Tx/Rx(separation)) i.e Corridor_rm155_7.1 : The environment is a narrow corridor with walls from one side and window from the other side and the Tx/Rx maximum separation is 7.1m and as the receiver is moved across the uniform grid it decreases.\n Each file will Loc_xxxx and this will resemble the location of the receiver and each location have ten measurements.

Apart from investigating sensor displacement, the dataset lend itself for benchmarking activity recognition techniques in ideal conditions.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDataset summary:\n#Activities: 33 \n#Sensors: 9\n#Subjects: 17\n#Scenarios: 3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ACTIVITY SET:\nA1: Walking  \nA2: Jogging  \nA3: Running  \nA4: Jump up  \nA5: Jump front & back  \nA6: Jump sideways  \nA7: Jump leg/arms open/closed  \nA8: Jump rope  \nA9: Trunk twist (arms outstretched)  \nA10: Trunk twist (elbows bent)  \nA11: Waist bends forward  \nA12: Waist rotation  \nA13: Waist bends (reach foot with opposite hand)  \nA14: Reach heels backwards  \nA15: Lateral bend (10_ to the left + 10_ to the right)\nA16: Lateral bend with arm up (10_ to the left + 10_ to the right) \nA17: Repetitive forward stretching \nA18: Upper trunk and lower body opposite twist \nA19: Lateral elevation of arms \nA20: Frontal elevation of arms \nA21: Frontal hand claps \nA22: Frontal crossing of arms \nA23: Shoulders high-amplitude rotation \nA24: Shoulders low-amplitude rotation \nA25: Arms inner rotation \nA26: Knees (alternating) to the breast \nA27: Heels (alternating) to the backside \nA28: Knees bending (crouching) \nA29: Knees (alternating) bending forward \nA30: Rotation on the knees \nA31: Rowing \nA32: Elliptical bike \nA33: Cycling \n SENSOR SETUP:\nEach sensor provides 3D acceleration (accX,accY,accZ), 3D gyro (gyrX,gyrY,gyrZ), 3D magnetic field orientation (magX,magY,magZ) and 4D quaternions (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4). The sensors are identified according to the body part on which is placed respectively:\n S1: left calf (LC)\nS2: left thigh (LT)\nS3: right calf (RC)\nS4: right thigh (RT)\nS5: back (BACK)\nS6: left lower arm (LLA)\nS7: left upper arm (LUA)\nS8: right lower arm (RLA)\nS9: right upper arm (RUA)\n SCENARIOS:\nThe dataset contains information for three different scenarios depending on whether the sensors are positioned on predefined positions or placed by the users themselves.\n- Ideal-placement or the default scenario. The sensors are positioned by the instructor on predefined locations within each body part. The data stemming from this scenario could be considered as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153training set\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for supervised activity recognition systems.\n- Self-placement. The user is asked to position a subset of the sensors themselves on the body parts specified by the instructor, but without providing any hint on how the sensors must be exactly placed. This scenario is devised to investigate some of the variability that may occur in the day-to-day usage of an activity recognition system, involving wearable or self-attached sensors. Normally, the self-placement will lead to on-body sensor setups that differ from the ideal-placement. Nevertheless, this difference may be minimal if the subject places the sensor close to the ideal position.\n- Induced-displacement. An intentional mispositioning of sensors using rotations and translations with respect to the ideal placement is introduced by the instructor. One of the key interests of including this last scenario is to investigate how the performance of a certain method degrades as the system drifts far from the ideal setup.\n A complete and illustrated description (including table of activities, sensor setup, etc.) of the dataset is provided in the documentation facilitated along with the dataset. Also, the papers presented in the section \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citation Requests\u00e2\u20ac\u009d provide an insightful description of the dataset and the underlying theory.  \n", "attrInformation": "The dataset comprises the readings of motion sensors recorded while users executed typical daily activities.

The TAO array consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific, measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection, understanding and prediction of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations originating in the tropics, most notably those related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. \n The moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Each mooring measures air temperature, relative humidity, surface winds, sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents, rainfall and solar radiation. The data from the array, and current updates, can be viewed on the web at the this address . \n The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of 1982-1983, the strongest of the century, created many problems throughout the world. Parts of the world such as Peru and the Unites States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires. The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak. This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system (i.e. the TAO array) to support studies of large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. \n The TAO array provides real-time data to climate researchers, weather prediction centers and scientists around the world. Forcasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data. These forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys, along with drifting buoys, volunteer ship temperature probes, and sea level measurements. \n Research questions of interest include: \n - How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world? \n- How do the variables relate to each other? \n- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations? \n- Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data? \n- When performing an analysis of the data, one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation. Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today's weather. \n The data is stored in an ASCII files with one observation per line. Spaces separate fields and periods (.) denote missing values. \n More information and data from the TAO array can be found at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory TAO data webpage: [Web Link]  Information on storm data is available here: [Web Link]. This site contains data from January 1994 to April 1998 in a chronological listing by state provided by the National Weather Service. The data includes hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, hail, floods, drought conditions, lightning, high winds, snow, and temperature extremes. \n Hurricane tracking data for the Atlantic is available here: [Web Link]. The site contains a map showing the paths of the Atlantic hurricanes and also includes the storms winds (in knots), pressure (in millibars), and the category of the storm based on Saffir-Simpson scale. \n Another site of interest related to the ENSO cyles is available here: [Web Link]. This site contains information on twelve areas of the world that have demonstrated ENSO-precipitation relationships. Included in the site are maps of the areas and time series plots of actual daily precipitation and accumulated normal precipitation for the areas. \n", "attrInformation": "The data consists of the following variables: date, latitude, longitude, zonal winds (west<0, east>0), meridional winds (south<0, north>0), relative humidity, air temperature, sea surface temperature and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters. Data taken from the buoys from as early as 1980 for some locations. Other data that was taken in various locations are rainfall, solar radiation, current levels, and subsurface temperatures. \n The latitude and longitude in the data showed that the bouys moved around to different locations. The latitude values stayed within a degree from the approximate location. Yet the longitude values were sometimes as far as five degrees off of the approximate location. \n Looking at the wind data, both the zonal and meridional winds fluctuated between -10 m/s and 10 m/s. The plot of the two wind variables showed no linear relationship. Also, the plots of each wind variable against the other three meteorolgical data showed no linear relationships. \n The relative humidity values in the tropical Pacific were typically between 70% and 90%. \n Both the air temperature and the sea surface temperature fluctuated between 20 and 30 degrees Celcius. The plot of the two temperatures variables shows a positive linear relationship existing. The two temperatures when each plotted against time also have similar plot designs. Plots of the other meteorological variables against the temperature variables showed no linear relationship. \n There are missing values in the data. As mentioned earlier, not all buoys are able to measure currents, rainfall, and solar radiation, so these values are missing dependent on the individual buoy. The amount of data available is also dependent on the buoy, as certain buoys were commissioned earlier than others. \n All readings were taken at the same time of day. \n ", "image": null}, {"link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/APS+Failure+at+Scania+Trucks", "datasetFolder": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00421/", "datasetDescription": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/APS+Failure+at+Scania+Trucks#", "title": "APS Failure at Scania Trucks Data Set", "dsFeatures": "Multivariate", "numberObs": "60000", "area": "Computer", "atributeType": "Integer, Real", "numberAttr": "171", "dateDonated": "2017-12-08", "missingValues": "Yes", "numberWebHits": "32700", "abstract": "The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system.

Commercials occupy almost 40-60%  of total air time. Manual segmentation of commercials from thousands of TV news channels is time consuming, and economically infeasible hence prompts the need for machine learning based Method. Classifying TV News commercials is a semantic video classification problem. TV News commercials on particular news channel are combinations of video shots uniquely characterized by audio-visual presentation. Hence various audio visual features extracted from video shots are widely used for TV commercial classification.  Indian News channels do not follow any particular news presentation format, have large variability and  dynamic nature presenting a challenging machine learning problem.  Features from 150 Hours of broadcast news videos from 5 different ( 3 Indian and  2 International News channels)  news channels. Viz. CNNIBN, NDTV 24X7, TIMESNOW, BBC and CNN are presented in this dataset.  Videos are recorded at resolution of 720 X 576 at 25 fps  using a DVR and set top box. 3 Indian channels are recorded concurrently while 2 International are recorded together. Feature file preserves the order of occurrence of shots.  ", "attrInformation": "Video shots are used as unit for generating instances. Broadcast News videos are segmented into video shots using RGB Colour Histogram matching Between consecutive video frames. From each video shot we have extracted 7 Audio ( viz. Short term energy,  zero crossing rate, Spectral Centroid, spectral Flux, spectral Roll off frequency, fundamental frequency and MFCC Bag of Audio Words) and 5 visual Features ( viz. Video shot length, Screen Text Distribution,  Motion Distribution, Frame Difference Distribution, Edge Change Ratio) from each video shot. Details of each extracted feature are as follows.\nAudio Features :- \nIn general to attract viewer's attention TV commercials have higher audio amplitude, appropriate background music ( comparatively higher frequencies) as well as sharp transitions from one music to other or music to speech etc. We try to capture these properties by using low level audio features -- Short Time Energy (STE) ,  Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Spectral Centroid, Spectral Flux,  Spectral Roll-Off Frequency and Fundamental Frequency.  All of these short term audio features are calculated with audio frame size of 20 msec at 8000Hz sampling Frequency.  The Mean and standard deviation of all audio feature values are calculated over the shot, generating a 2D vector for each feature. \nThe MFCC Bag of Audio Words have been successfully used in several existing speech/audio processing applications. This motivated us to compute the MFCC coefficients along with Delta and Delta-Delta Cepstrum from 150 hours of audio tracks. These coefficients are clustered into 4000 groups which form the Audio words. Each shot is then represented as a  4000 Dimensional Bag of Audio Words by forming the normalized histograms of the MFCC's extracted from 20 ms windows with overlap of 10 ms in the shots. \n Video Features : \nCommercial video shots are usually short in length, fast visual transitions with peculiar placement of overlaid text bands. Video Shot Length is directly used as one of the feature. Placement of overlaid text bands is represented by  15 dimensional overlaid Text Distribution. To calculate Text Distribution feature, video frame is divided into a grid of size 5 X 3( 15 grid blocks).  The text distribution feature is obtained by averaging the fraction of text area present in a grid block over all frames of the shot. Motion Distribution, Frame Change Distribution and Edge Change Ratio captures the dynamic nature of the commercial shots. \nMotion Distribution is obtained by first computing dense optical flow (Horn-Schunk formulation) followed by  construction of a distribution of flow magnitudes over the entire shot with 40 uniformly divided bins in range of [0, 40]. Sudden changes in pixel intensities are grasped by Frame Difference Distribution. Such changes are not registered by optical flow. Thus, Frame Difference Distribution is also computed along with flow magnitude distributions. We obtain the frame difference by averaging absolute frame difference in each of 3 color channels and the distribution is constructed with 32 bins in the range of [0, 255] . Edge Change Ratio Captures the motion of edges between consecutive frames and is defined as ratio of displaced edge pixels to the total number of edge pixels in a frame. We calculate the mean and variance of the ECR over the entire shot. \n  The Feature File is represented in Lib SVM data format and contains approximetly 63% commercial instances( Positives).

The learning system is provided with examples of chess positions described only by the coordinates of the pieces on the board. Background knowledge in the form of row and column differences is also supplied. The relations necessary to form a correct and concise classifier for the target concept must be discovered by the learning system (the examples already provide a complete extensional definition). The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain.\n Chess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored denote whether or not positions are won for either side, or include also the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft, 1986) for testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from, say, a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson, 1986).\n A KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct, but the class distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a fixed number of moves, assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw, zero, one, ..., sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and correct solution for this task.\n The typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.", "attrInformation": "   1.

Duncan\n    Quinnipiac University\n christian.duncan '@' quinnipiac.edu", "information": "A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove. \n A rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx.\n The 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.\n The data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.\n Due to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy. \n This dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.\n In previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.\n", "attrInformation": "Data is provided as a CSV file.

One may randomly permute the visible (not missing) markers of a given record without changing the set that the record represents.

This dataset was already used in the experiments described in Freitas et al. (2014).\n    The dataset is composed by eighteen videos recorded using Microsoft Kinect sensor.

Many of the less useful attributes in the original data set have been dropped, the few continuous variables have been discretized and the few discrete variables that have a large number of possible values have been collapsed to have fewer possible values. \n More specifically the USCensus1990 data set was obtained from the USCensus1990raw data set by the following sequence of operations; \n - Randomization: The order of the cases in the original USCensus1990raw data set were randomly permuted. \n- Selection of attributes: The 68 attributes included in the data set are given below. In the USCensus1990 data set we have added a single letter prefix to the original name. We add the letter 'i' to indicate that the original attribute values are used and 'd' to indicate that original attribute values for each case have been mapped to new values (the precise mapping is described below). \n Hierarchies of values are provided in the file USCensus1990raw.coding.htm and the mapping functions used to transform the USCensus1990raw to the USCensus1990 data sets are giving in the file USCensus1990.mapping.sql. \n The data is contained in a file called USCensus1990.data.txt. The first row contains the list of attributes. The first attribute is a caseid and should be ignored during analysis. The data is comma delimited with one case per row.

The mappings for the variables dAncstry1, dAncstry2, dHispanic, dIndustry, dOccup, dPOB were designed to correspond to a natural coarsening of the original values based on the information in the file coding.htm. The remaining variables are continuous valued variables and the mapping for these variables was chosen to make variables that were fairly uniformly distributed across the states (quantiles). The precise mappings are specified in the file USCensus1990.mapping.sql. This file contains all of T-SQL procedures used to map the variables. These procedures can be used directly in SQLServer to map the original values or translated to some other language. \n      --------------------------------------------------------------\n        Variable        Procedure\n      --------------------------------------------------------------\n        dAge            discAge\n        dAncstry1       discAncstry1\n        dAncstry2       discAncstry2\n        dHispanic       discHispanic\n        dHour89         discHour89\n        dHours          discHours\n        dIncome1        discIncome1\n        dIncome2        discIncome2to8\n        dIncome3        discIncome2to8\n        dIncome4        discIncome2to8\n        dIncome5        discIncome2to8\n        dIncome6        discIncome2to8\n        dIncome7        discIncome2to8\n        dIncome8        discIncome2to8\n        dIndustry       discIndustry\n        dOccup          discOccup\n        dPOB            discPOB\n        dPoverty        discPoverty\n        dPwgt1          discPwgt1\n        dRearning       discRearning\n        dRpincome       discRpincome\n        dTravtime       discTravtime\n        dWeek89         discWeek89\n        dYrsserv        discYrsserv\n ", "image": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/assets/MLimages/Large2.jpg"}, {"link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Data+for+Software+Engineering+Teamwork+Assessment+in+Education+Setting", "datasetFolder": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00393/", "datasetDescription": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Data+for+Software+Engineering+Teamwork+Assessment+in+Education+Setting#", "title": "Data for Software Engineering Teamwork Assessment in Education Setting Data Set", "dsFeatures": "Sequential, Time-Series", "numberObs": "74", "area": "Computer", "atributeType": "Integer, Real", "numberAttr": "102", "dateDonated": "2017-06-29", "missingValues": "Yes", "numberWebHits": "25274", "abstract": "Data include over 100 Team Activity Measures and outcomes (ML classes) obtained from activities of 74 student teams during the creation of final class project in SW Eng. classes  at SFSU, Fulda, FAU", "source": "Prof. D.

All students consented to this data\n#  being shared for research purposes provided no uniquely identifiable\n#  information was contained in the distributed files.  The information\n#  was collected through various means, with emphasis being placed on\n#  the collection of objective, quantifiable information.  For more\n#  information on the data collection procedures, please see the paper\n#  referenced above.\n#\n#\n#  PRIVACY\n#  -------\n#  The data contained in this file does not contain any information\n#  which may be individually traced to a particular student who\n#  participated in the study.\n#\n#\n#  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES AND DERIVATIONS\n#  -------------------------------------------------\n#  SAMs (Student Activity Measure) are collected for each student team\n#  member during their participation in a software engineering class.\n#  Student teams work together on a final class project, and comprise\n#  5-6 students.  Teams that are made up of students from only one\n#  school are labeled local teams.  Teams made up of students from more\n#  than one school are labeled global teams.  SAMs are collected from:\n#  weekly timecards, instructor observations, and software engineering\n#  tool usage logs.  SAMs are then aggregated by team and time interval\n#  (see next section) into TAMs (Team Activity Measure).  Outcomes are\n#  determined at the end of the semester through evaluation of student\n#  team work in two categories:  software engineering process (how well\n#  the team applied best software engineering practices), and software\n#  engineering product (the quality of the finished product the team\n#  produced).  Thus for each team, two outcomes are determined, process\n#  and product, respectively.  Outcomes are classified into two class\n#  grades, A or F.  A represents teams that are at or above\n#  expectations, F represents teams that are below expectations or need\n#  attention.  For more information, please see the paper referenced\n#  above.\n#\n#  The SE process and SE product outcomes represent ML training classes\n#  and are to be considered separately, e.g. one should train ML for SE\n#  process separately from training for SE product.\n#\n#  TIME INTERVALS FOR WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED\n#  ------------------------------------------\n#  Data collected continuously throughout the semester are aggregated\n#  into different time intervals for the semester's project reflecting\n#  different dynamics of teamwork during the class.  Time intervals\n#  represent time periods in which a milestone was developed by each\n#  team.  A milestone represents a major deliverable point in the class\n#  for all student teams.  The milestones are roughly divided into the\n#  following topics:\n#\n#            M1 - high level requirements and specs\n#            M2 - more detailed requirements and specs\n#            M3 - first prototype\n#            M4 - beta release\n#            M5 - final delivery\n#\n#  Time intervals are combinations of the time in which milestones are\n#  being produced.  Time intervals are used in research only.\n#\n#  In addition to time intervals corresponding to milestones, a number\n#  of time intervals combining multiple T1-T5 time intervals have been\n#  calculated.  This was done to group student activities into design\n#  vs. implementation phases which have different dynamics.\n#\n#  These time intervals are defined as follows:\n#\n#      Time Interval        Corresponding Milestone Periods in Class\n#    -----------------    --------------------------------------------\n#           0               Milestone 0\n#           1               Milestone 1\n#           2               Milestone 2\n#           3               Milestone 3\n#           4               Milestone 4\n#           5               Milestone 5\n#           6               Milestone 1 - Milestone 2 inclusive\n#           7               Milestone 1 - Milestone 3 inclusive\n#           8               Milestone 1 - Milestone 4 inclusive\n#           9               Milestone 1 - Milestone 5 inclusive\n#          10               Milestone 4 - Milestone 5 inclusive\n#          11               Milestone 3 - Milestone 5 inclusive\n#\n#\n#\n#  SETAP PROJECT OVERALL DATA STATISTICS\n#  ================================================================== \n#  The following is a set of statistics about the entire dataset which\n#  may be useful in the configuration of machine learning methods.\n#\n#  This data was collected only from students at SFSU.

By using this systematic approach, TAM feature names are\n#  produced that are human understandable and intuitive and related to\n#  aggregation method.\n#\n#\n#  There are a number of base TAM which are then aggregated into\n#  aggregated TAM.\n#\n#  BASE TAM\n#  --------\n#\n#  General TAM\n#  -----------\n#  The following TAMs are collected for each team: Year, semester,\n#  timeInterval, teamNumber, semesterId, teamMemberCount,\n#  femaleTeamMembersPercent, teamLeadGender, teamDistribution\n#\n#  Calculated TAM\n#  --------------\n#  For each team, TAM were calculated from SAMs for every time interval\n#  Ti.

The naming conventions and\n#  aggregation operators to obtain TAMs for each time interval Ti were\n#  as follows:\n#\n#  Total - total sum of VAR in the time interval Ti\n#  Average - average of VAR in the time interval\n#  StandardDeviation - SD of variable in time interval\n#  Count - count of events measured by VAR (e.g. missed\n#  checkpoints) in time interval\n#  AverageByWeek - total sum/count of VAR in the time interval\n#  divided by weeks in time interval\n#  StandradDeviationByWeek - the standard devation of the weekly\n#  total of VAR taken over the time interval\n#  AverageByStudent - total count/sum of VAR in time interval,\n#  divided by number of students in the team\n#  StandardDeviation ByStudent - standard deviation of  VAR in the\n#  time interval, over students in the team\n#\n#\n#  NULL VALUES\n#  -----------\n#  NULL values are used in the training data to indicate that no SAMs\n#  were recorded in that particular time period, week, or for that\n#  student.\n#\n#  Frequently TAM features involving teamLeadHours or globalTeamLead\n#  hours will result in a NULL for a particular training sample.  For\n#  local team leads, that usually means that the local team lead did\n#  not complete any timecard surveys for the aggregation in quesiton.\n#  While for global team lead TAM features this may also be the case,\n#  the more usual cause of NULLS in global team lead TAM features comes\n#  from the fact that most teams are not global, and therefore this\n#  statistic was not gathered for these teams.\n#\n#  It is left to the individual researcher to decide how to accomodate\n#  NULL values, and the data is included in this file.  Though these\n#  may not be useful for machine learning directly, valuable\n#  information can be obatined with some processing.\n#\n#  TAM FEATURES\n#  ------------\n#  The following is a list of tam features available in the data files.\n#  The TAM feature names are listed in the order in which the data\n#  appear in each training sample, i.e. the first feature corresponds\n#  to the first column, the second feature corresponds to the second\n#  column, etc.\n#\n#  The first sample line in the data section of the data file is not a\n#  true sample, but consists of TAM feature names, which allows for\n#  easy import into spreadsheets and for human readability.\n#\n#  The final two TAM features (columns) are the outcome data for\n#  process and product, and are the last two columns in each sample\n#  row.

Since the weights of stock-picking concepts in a weighted scoring stock selection model can be regarded as components in a mixture, we used the simplex centroid mixture design to obtain the experimental sets of weights. These sets of weights are simulated with US stock market historical data to obtain their performances. Performance prediction models were built with the simulated performance data set and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the optimization models to reflect investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences were built up, and the performance prediction models were employed as the kernel of the optimization models so that the optimal solutions can now be solved with optimization techniques. The empirical values of the performances of the optimal weighting combinations generated by the optimization models showed that they can meet various investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preferences and outperform those of S&P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 not only during the training period but also during the testing period.", "attrInformation": "The inputs are the weights of the stock-picking concepts as follows\nX1=the weight of the Large B/P concept\nX2=the weight of the Large ROE concept\nX3=the weight of the Large S/P concept\nX4=the weight of the Large Return Rate in the last quarter concept\nX5=the weight of the Large Market Value concept\nX6=the weight of the Small systematic Risk concept\n The outputs are the investment performance indicators (normalized) as follows\nY1=Annual Return\nY2=Excess Return\nY3=Systematic Risk\nY4=Total Risk\nY5=Abs.

From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression. \n Handwriting dataset was constructed using Wacom Cintiq 12WX graphics (Hahne et al., 2009) table. It is basically a graphics tablet and LCD monitor rolled into one. It enables to display a PC's screen on its monitor and only interacts with digitized pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1]. \n In this study, there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe Static Spiral Test (SST) which is frequently used for clinical research in the literature for different purposes like determining motor performance (Wang et al., 2008), measuring tremor (Pullman, 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al., 2008). In this test, three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test, the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database. \n The second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST, Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals, in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test, it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern. \n The third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test, there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level. \n Further details are contained in the following reference -- if you use this dataset, please cite: \n 1.Isenkul, M.E.; Sakar, B.E.; Kursun, O. .

Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog), the record ID is also included as an extra column. We used the spectral entropy and a binary cluster method to detect audio frames belonging to each syllable. The segmentation and feature extraction were carried out in Matlab. After the segmentation we got 7195 syllables, which became instances for train and test the classifier. These records were collected in situ under real noise conditions (the background sound).

A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many \nunderground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in \nthis respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic \nmonitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard \nprediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of \nseismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number \nof high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict \nseismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction, \nalso using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be \napplied (Lesniak A., Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the \nZabrze-Bielszowice coal mine, Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 46(5), 2009, \n918-928), and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz, J.: Effect \nof the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks. \nGeotechnical and Geological Engineering, 24(5), 2005, 1131-1147). In the majority of applications, the \nresults obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as \n'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous'. Unbalanced distribution of positive ('hazardous state') and negative \n('non-hazardous state') examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used \nmethods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper \n(Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on \nnatural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences, 42(6), 2006, 570-577) a number of factors having \nan effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed, among other factors, the occurrence of tremors with \nenergy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways, but the main \naim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and \ndate) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a \nsummary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision \nattribute has the value 1, then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was \nregistered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded \ntremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence, such hazard \nprognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover, with the information about the \npossibility of hazardous situation occurrence, an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of \nrockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction \nof increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance.   The presented data \nset is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples. In the data set there \nare only 170 positive examples representing class 1.\n", "attrInformation": "Attribute information:\n1. seismic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the seismic \nmethod (a - lack of hazard, b - low hazard, c - high hazard, d - danger state);\n2. seismoacoustic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the \nseismoacoustic method;\n3. shift: information about type of a shift (W - coal-getting, N -preparation shift);\n4. genergy: seismic energy recorded within previous shift by the most active geophone (GMax) out of \ngeophones monitoring the longwall;\n5. gpuls: a number of pulses recorded within previous shift by GMax;\n6. gdenergy: a deviation of energy recorded within previous shift by GMax from average energy recorded \nduring eight previous shifts;\n7. gdpuls: a deviation of a number of pulses recorded within previous shift by GMax from average number \nof pulses recorded during eight previous shifts;\n8. ghazard: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the \nseismoacoustic method based on registration coming form GMax only;\n9. nbumps: the number of seismic bumps recorded within previous shift;\n10. nbumps2: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^2,10^3)) registered within previous shift;\n11. nbumps3: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^3,10^4)) registered within previous shift;\n12. nbumps4: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^4,10^5)) registered within previous shift;\n13. nbumps5: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^5,10^6)) registered within the last shift;\n14. nbumps6: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^6,10^7)) registered within previous shift;\n15. nbumps7: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^7,10^8)) registered within previous shift;\n16. nbumps89: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^8,10^10)) registered within previous shift;\n17. energy: total energy of seismic bumps registered within previous shift;\n18. maxenergy: the maximum energy of the seismic bumps registered within previous shift;\n19. class: the decision attribute - '1' means that high energy seismic bump occurred in the next shift \n('hazardous state'), '0' means that no high energy seismic bumps occurred in the next shift \n ('non-hazardous state').", "image": null}, {"link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS", "datasetFolder": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00280/", "datasetDescription": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS#", "title": "HIGGS Data Set", "dsFeatures": "N/A", "numberObs": "11000000", "area": "Physical", "atributeType": "Real", "numberAttr": "28", "dateDonated": "2014-02-12", "missingValues": "N/A", "numberWebHits": "110204", "abstract": "This is a classification problem to distinguish between a signal process which produces Higgs bosons and a background process which does not.

Our hope was to cover most of the types of sensory interactions that a Pioneer might be reasonably expected to encounter: things like passing by visible objects, pushing visible objects, crashing into walls, etc. Many of these interactions are repeated throughout the dataset.\n This data was collected to serve as the basis for work in learning and conceptual development. Our first goal was to be able to have the robot cluster these experiences by their dynamics on their own into clusters of experiences with a common outcome.\n Each data file contains time series data in which each row of data corresponds to a single observation of the sensor array. Included in each row are two additional variables, 'id' and 'description', which indicate the experience number that the observation belongs to, and a description of that experience, respectively. Observations within an experience are taken every 100ms. \n The data is stored in three text files: one file for experiences in which the Pioneer was moving in a straight line, one in which it was turning in place, and one in which it was raising or lowering its gripper.\n The description variable is a string of symbols. The string breaks down as follows:\n \"u\" or \"o\" -  unobstructed or obstructed\n\"x.xs\"     -  activity lasted x.x seconds\nactivity   -  the activity and speed, if applicable, i.e. move100 = move forward at 100mm/sec\nvisual     -  objects in the visual array are listed in sequence. \"cAHEAD\" indicates an object visible to channel c directly AHEAD of the Pioneer.\n[visual.X] -  visual descriptions followed by a '.' and one character indicate that something special happens with the visible object. .V means the object Vanishes from sight during the activity. .D indicates that the object is Discovered (becomes visible) during the activity. .P indicates that the object is pushed. \n An example: \"u-3.5s-retr-100-aRIGHT.D\"  An unobstructed retreat (move) at -100 mm/sec for 3.5 seconds with an object being discovered in channel A.\n It should be noted that, particularly with respect to the visual channels, the description may not be 100% accurate. Since the visual channels respond to colors that they are trained on (visual a=red, visual b=yellow, visual c=blue), it was possible, but infrequent, for some extraneous object in the environment generated a response in visual channels that were not supposed to show activity in a particular trial.\n Rows are seperated by carriage returns, columns by commas.

Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown, they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2. \n Shown here are example plots of a control ([Web Link]) and alcoholic ([Web Link]) subject.

The acquired time series of the sensors are provided.\n The experimental setup was designed to test gas sensors in realistic environments. Traditionally, chemical detection systems based on chemo-resistive sensors include a gas chamber to control the sample air flow and minimize turbulence. Instead, we utilized a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources that generate two gas plumes. The plumes get naturally mixed along a turbulent flow and reproduce the gas concentration fluctuations observed in natural environments. Hence, the gas sensors can capture the spatio-temporal information contained in the gas plumes.\n a) Chemical detection platform:\nThe chemical detection platform was composed of 8 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro (TGS2611, TGS2612, TGS2610, TGS2600, TGS2602 TGS2620). The operating temperature of the sensors was controlled by the built-in heater, which was kept at a constant voltage of 5V. The detection platform also includes Temperature and Relative Humidity sensors. The generated sensors' responses were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 ms for the whole duration of the experiment.\n b) Wind tunnel:\nIn order to generate two independent gas plumes in an open environment, we built a 2.5 m x 1.2 m x 0.4 m wind tunnel facility with two gas sources (labeled as source1 and source2). Each source was controlled independently to release the selected volatiles at different flow rates, which generated different concentration levels in the sensors' position. The wind generator created a turbulent flow that constantly displaced the introduced volatiles towards the exhaust outlet.\n c) Experimental protocol:\nWe exposed the detection unit to mixtures of Ethylene with Methane or Carbon Monoxide. The mixtures were originated releasing Ethylene at source1 and releasing Methane / Carbon Monoxide at source2.\n Each volatile was released at four different flows (zero z, low l, medium m, and high h), providing up to 30 different mixture configurations: 15 mixtures of Ethylene with CO (h+h, h+m, h+l, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6, z+h, z+m, z+l) and 15 mixtures of Ethylene with Methane. Each configuration was repeated 6 times. Hence, the complete dataset was composed of 180 measurements, which were performed in a random order. \n By means of a GCMS system, the mean concentration levels at the sensors' location were estimated: Ethylene (l: 31 ppm, m: 46 ppm, h: 96 ppm), CO (l: 270 ppm, m: 397 ppm, h: 460 ppm), Methane (l: 51 ppm, m: 115 ppm, h: 131 ppm). It is worth noting that GC-MS systems only provide the mean value of the concentration and are not sensitive to concentration fluctuations.\n Each measurement, which had a total duration of 300 seconds, was performed as follows: Initially no gas was released and clean air flowed along the wind tunnel. 60 seconds after, both sources started to release the corresponding volatile at the specified flow rate. The duration of the gas release was 180 s. Finally, the system acquired the recovery to the baseline for another 60 s.

The filenames identify the measurements as follows: The first 3 characters of the filename are a local identifier, which is not related to the order of the measurements; characters 5-8 indicate the concentration level of Ethylene released at source2 (n: zero, L: Low, M: Medium, H: High); the last 4 characters indicate the gas released at source1 (Me: Methane, CO: Carbon Monoxide) and the concentration level. \n For example, file 007_Et_L_Me_H contains time series acquired when Ethylene was released at Low concentration (31 ppm, mean concentration) and Methane at High concentration (131 ppm, mean concentration). \n Each file includes the acquired time series, presented in 11 columns: Time (s), Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), and the readings of the 8 gas sensors: TGS2600, TGS2602, TGS2602, TGS2620, TGS2612, TGS2620, TGS2611, TGS2610.

The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. We captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.

Therefore, automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although, there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies, this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).\n Although there are many papers in the literature trying to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based method, there still exists one important drawback in this field which is the lack of a common database for comparison purposes. So, UJIIndoorLoc database is presented to overcome this gap. We expect that the proposed database will become the reference database to compare different indoor localization methodologies based on WiFi fingerprinting.\n The UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification, e.g. actual building and floor identification, or regression, e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices. The database consists of 19937 training/reference records (trainingData.csv file) and 1111 validation/test records (validationData.csv file).\n The 529 attributes contain the WiFi fingerprint, the coordinates where it was taken, and other useful information.\n Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging -104dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0dbM. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.\n Then the coordinates (latitude, longitude, floor) and Building ID are provided as the attributes to be predicted. \n Additional information has been provided.\n The particular space (offices, labs, etc.) and the relative position (inside/outside the space) where the capture was taken have been recorded. Outside means that the capture was taken in front of the door of the space.\n Information about who (user), how (android device & version) and when (timestamp) WiFi capture was taken is also recorded.\n   ", "attrInformation": "Attribute 001 (WAP001): Intensity value for WAP001.

Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: \"Never Used\", \"Used over a Decade Ago\", \"Used in Last Decade\", \"Used in Last Year\", \"Used in Last Month\", \"Used in Last Week\", and \"Used in Last Day\".Problem which can be solved:* Seven class classifications for each drug separately.* Problem can be transformed to binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class.

The next task has been cleaning the dataset due to OCR reading problems in the original raw form. To achieve that, firstly all books have been scanned through to get the overall number of unique words and each words frequencies. While scanning the texts, the first 500 words and the last 500 words have been removed to take out specific features such as the name of the author, the name of the book and other word specific features that could make the classification task easier. After this step, we have chosen top 10,000 words that occurred in the whole 50 authors text data corpus. The words that are not in top 10,000 words were removed while keeping the rest of the sentence structure intact. The entire book is split into text fragments with 1000 words each. We separately maintained author and book identification number for each one of them in different arrays. Text segments with less than 1000 words were filled with zeros to keep them in the dataset as well. 1000 words make approximately 2 pages of writing, which is long enough to extract a variety of features from the document.

This allows the calculation of 4 pieces of information: x (left/right), y (up/down), z (backward/forward), and roll (is the palm pointing up or down?). x, y and z are measured with 8 bit accuracy. \"x, y, z\" should not be taken to be the normal 3-dimensional orthogonal basis. In particular, 1 unit in the z direction is not of similar distance to 1 unit in the x or y directions. These x, y, z positions are relative to a calibration point which is when the palm is resting on the seated signer's thigh. Roll is 4 bits. \n The data is susceptible to occasional \"spikes\" caused by random ultrasound noise. Median filters have been found to be beneficial in solving this problem. \n Finger bend is generated by conductive bend sensors on the first four fingers. Values vary between 0 (straight) and 3 (fully bent). Accuracy is 2 bits. The gloves automatically apply a hysteresis filter on these bend sensors. At best, these measurements should be treated sceptically. \n See past usage for a more detailed discussion on the data collection methodology. \n The data was collected from five signers: \n Signer -- Description -- Sessions -- Total samples/sign\n  Adam -- Sign linguist - PhD completed in area. -- 2 -- 8\n Andrew -- Natural signer - signing since youth -- 3 -- 8\n John -- Professional Auslan interpreter -- 5 -- 18\n Stephen -- Professional Auslan interpreter -- 4  -- 16\n Waleed -- The researcher. Novice signer -- 4 -- 20\n Each session was taken at a different time, after a break, etc. \n The \"adam\" dataset were sampled in a fixed order -- this means that they are subject to fatigue effects, etc. All other datasets were sampled in random order. The \"waleed\" and \"stephen\" datasets contain signs that begin with \"cal-\". These were considered as a means of calibration, but didn't work out too well. \n The data presented is the raw data with no filtering. \n Occasional dropouts in x, y, z values. These can be easily fixed using a median filter. \n Average number of frames per instance is 51, but varies from 30 to 102. \n The data is in a comma separated file containing all of the attributes mentioned above. Each sign sample is stored in a single file. The directory hierarchy is as follows: \n-Each signer is in a separate directory. \n-Each session from signer is in a subdirectory. Each session is denoted by a number. \n-Each sample is in a file named by the sample appended with the number of the sample of that sign. \n The filenames indicate the class.

The devices measure the RSS of the beacon packets they exchange among themselves in the WSN [2].\n We collect RSS data using IRIS nodes embedding a Chipcon AT86RF230 radio subsystem that implements the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and programmed with a TinyOS firmware. They are placed on the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest and ankles. For the purpose of communications, the beacon packets are exchanged by using a simple virtual token protocol that completes its execution in a time slot of 50 milliseconds. A modified version of the Spin ([Web Link]) token-passing protocol is used to schedule node transmission, in order to prevent packet collisions and maintain high data collection rate. When an anchor is transmitting, all other anchors receive the packet and perform the RSS measurements. The payload of the transmitting packet is the set of RSS values between the transmitting node and the other sensors sampled during the previous cycle.\n From the raw data we extract time-domain features to compress the time series and slightly remove noise and correlations.\n We choose an epoch time of 250 milliseconds according to the EVAAL technical annex.

Recently, process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert, to one in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation. The primary responsibilities of the human expert are to evaluate the merits of generated rules, and to guide the acquisition and classification of data necessary for machine induction. These responsibilities require the expert to do what an expert does best: to exercise his or her expertise. This seems a more natural fit to an expert's capabilities than the requirements of traditional methodologies that experts explicitly enumerate the rules that they employ.", "attrInformation": "\t 1. timestamp: numeric;19500101 - 21001231 \n\t 2. cylinder number: nominal\n\t 3. customer: nominal; \n\t 4. job number: nominal; \n\t 5. grain screened: nominal; yes, no \n\t 6. ink color: nominal;  key, type \n\t 7. proof on ctd ink:  nominal;  yes, no  \n\t 8. blade mfg: nominal;  benton, daetwyler, uddeholm \n\t 9. cylinder division: nominal;  gallatin, warsaw, mattoon \n\t10. paper type: nominal;  uncoated, coated, super \n\t11. ink type: nominal;  uncoated, coated, cover \n\t12. direct steam: nominal; use; yes, no *\n\t13. solvent type: nominal;  xylol, lactol, naptha, line, other \n\t14. type on cylinder:  nominal;  yes, no  \n\t15. press type: nominal; use; 70 wood hoe, 70 motter, 70 albert, 94 motter \n\t16. press: nominal;  821, 802, 813, 824, 815, 816, 827, 828 \n\t17. unit number: nominal;  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \n\t18. cylinder size: nominal;  catalog, spiegel, tabloid \n\t19. paper mill location: nominal; north us, south us, canadian, scandanavian, mid european\n\t20. plating tank: nominal; 1910, 1911, other \n\t21. proof cut: numeric;  0-100 \n\t22. viscosity: numeric;  0-100 \n\t23. caliper: numeric;  0-1.0 \n\t24. ink temperature: numeric;  5-30 \n\t25. humifity: numeric;  5-120 \n\t26. roughness: numeric;  0-2 \n\t27. blade pressure: numeric;  10-75 \n\t28. varnish pct: numeric;  0-100 \n\t29. press speed: numeric;  0-4000 \n\t30. ink pct: numeric;  0-100 \n\t31. solvent pct: numeric;  0-100 \n\t32.

Our primary purpose is to make our dataset freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensing research and machine-learning communities, as well as other interested communities, to develop alternative competitive solutions relevant to gas-sensing discrimination tasks in open sampling settings, such as the one pursued here, and/or navigation. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.\nThe dataset was gathered from December 2010 to April 2012 (16 months) in a 2.5 m \u00c3\u2014 1.2 m \u00c3\u2014 0.4 m wind tunnel research test-bed facility situated at the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Specifically, our customized research facility, endowed with a computer-supervised mass flow controller-based continuous flow gas delivery system, operates in a propulsion open-cycle mode, by continuously drawing external turbulent air into and throughout the tunnel and exhausting it back to the outside, thereby creating a relatively less-turbulent airflow moving downstream towards the end of the test field, which is particularly suitable for applications pursued here that require injecting chemical poisonous agents or explosive mixtures because it prevents saturation. Being operated by a fully computerized environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201dcontrolled by a player/stage robot server software programmed on C++ on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial cards\u00e2\u20ac\u201d and with minimum human intervention, the designed wind tunnel test-bed facility provides versatility for releasing the chemical substances of interest at the desired concentrations with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner during the entire experiment and simultaneously in preserving the appropriate environmental conditions to generate chemical gas plumes exhibiting turbulent patterns. A graphical illustration of the designed wind tunnel test-bed facility considered in this study along with the characteristics of the geometry of the problem as well as the exact locations of the chemical analyte source and chemo-sensory platform is presented in Figure 2 of the manuscript cited below. Actual pictures of the designed wind tunnel are also presented in the Supplementary Material, Figure S.1 of the accompanying manuscript.\nThe resulting dataset induces a ten-class gas discrimination problem, comprising recordings from ten distinct pure chemical gases, namely Acetone, Acetaldehyde, Ammonia, Butanol, Ethylene, Methane, Methanol, Carbon Monoxide, Benzene, and Toluene. The goal is to identify and discriminate the mentioned chemical hazards at relevant concentrations regardless of the location of the sensory system platform within the annotated wind tunnel research facility as well as the environmental and parametric conditions induced in the setting (Please see manuscript for more details). See Table 1 on Vergara et a. 2013 (manuscript below) for specifics on the identity of chemical analyte hazards as well as their nominal concentration values at the outlet of the gas source in parts-per-million by volume (ppmv). Please refer to the manuscript below for a more details of the wind tunnel test-bed facility as well as for specifics on the collection procedure followed and the operating and environmental parameters utilized during the creation of the aforementioned dataset.\n", "attrInformation": "The response of the sensor platform is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active sensitive film of each of the 72 gas sensors integrating the sensor array; hence, each measurement produced a 72-channel time series, each of which represented by a 260-second time series collected at a sample rate of 100 samples per second (Hz), reflecting all the environmental changes in the evaluated scenario. For a more detailed analysis and discussion on the processing of the time series as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to Sections 2 and 3 and Figure 4, respectively, of the manuscript below.\nFor manipulation purposes, the data is organized into eleven folders, each containing the number of measurements per chemical class identity and nominal concentration indicated above and described in the Table 2 of the manuscript. For example the folder named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toluene_200\u00e2\u20ac\u009d means the name of the gas identity is Toluene, which has been dosed at 200 ppmv. Each folder contains 6 folders, each representing the line location within the test area of the wind tunnel (location 1, L1, to location 6, L6, being L1 the closest point to the gas source) from which the set of time-series were recorded. In each of these folders there are 300 files, each of which corresponding to the number of measurements recorded at each location in the tunnel. The name of each file contains the exact log information of each of the measurements performed during the entire experiment, which is organized as follows. The first 12 digits of the file name (e.g., 201106060617) indicate the date and time at which each specific measurement was collected, starting from the year, month, day, and time. The last 4 digits in the following 19 characters of the name file, (e.g., board_setPoint_500V), indicate the fixed operating temperature value, represented by a voltage value applied to the embedded heating element in the chemical sensor, applied to the entire sensing platform, which can adopt nominal values from 4 to 6 V with an resolution value of 0.5 V. Note that the value 500V in the example is a graphical representation of the 5V value applied to the sensor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heater. For more details on the operating principles of the chemical sensors utilized in our platform please refer to Section 2 of the manuscript. The last 3 digits in the following 16 characters of the file name (e.g., fan_setPoint_060) indicates the set-point value of the nominal rotational speeds of the multiple-step motor-driven exhaust fan utilized to induce the distinct artificial airflows speed in the wind tunnel. Only three values were adopted in this condition: the value \u00e2\u20ac\u0153000\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the file name, which indicates the slowest rotational speed (1500 rpm), the value \u00e2\u20ac\u0153060\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, indicating the mid-point rotational speed value of the fan (3900rpm), and the value \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which refers to the fastest induced speed of the fan, 5500 rpm. The last 14 characters of the following string of 27 characters (e.g., mfc_setPoint_Toluene_200ppm) describe the analyte identity and concentration value for each particular measurement. Thus, the just mentioned example represents the class corresponding to the chemical analyte identity \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toluene\u00e2\u20ac\u009d dosed at the nominal concentration value of 200 ppm. Finally, the last 2 or 3 digits in the name (e.g., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153p7\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) describe the line point location at which the chemo-sensory platform was located in the wind tunnel. Note that there is a shift of two numbers in the value of this position, i.e., the value p7 in actuality represents the line location 4 illustrated in Figure 2 of the cited manuscript. For example, in\n201106060617_board_setPoint_500V_fan_setPoint_060_mfc_setPoint_Toluene_200ppm_p7\nthe entire text line stands for a stand-alone measurement of the chemo-sensory platform located at the line location L4 and in response to 200 ppm of Toluene collected on June 06 of 2011, at 06:17 am (PST), with an operating voltage applied to the heater of 5V and a nominal rotational speed of the exhaust fan of 3900 rpm.\n Having described the naming configuration adopted in the generated dataset, we describe the organization of the information in each of the attached files of the dataset. The data format encloses information relevant to each measurement file, containing all the time series indicated above (9 portable modules \u00c3\u2014 8 sensors, temperature and humidity values (oC and %, respectively), exhaust fan set-point and reading values, mass flow controller set-point and actual reading values (%), and reading time (ms)), which is organized as follows:\nReading time (ms) fan_set_point fan_reading* mcf1_setpoint mcf2_setpoint mcf3_setpoint mcf1_read mcf2_read mcf3_read T RH 1 board1(\u00c3\u2014 8 chemical sensors) 1 board2(\u00c3\u2014 8 chemical sensors) 1 .... 1 board9(\u00c3\u2014 8 chemical sensors)\n where: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reading time (ms)\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the time step for each recording (in ms, at a sample rate of 100 Hz), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fan_set_point\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fan_reading\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, is the set-point and actual reading of the exhaust fan, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mcf1_setpoint\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mcf3_setpoint\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are the opening degree set-point values given to the mass flow controllers 1 to 3 during the experiment, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mcf1_read\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mcf1_read\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are the measured opening degree of mass flow controllers 1 to 3, respectively, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153R\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are the temperature and relative humidity values (in oC and %, respectively) during the entire experiment, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153board1(\u00c3\u2014 8 chemical sensors)\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153board9(\u00c3\u2014 8 chemical sensors)\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are the 72 time series collected as a function of time from the 8 gas sensors (in K\u00ce\u00a9) integrating modules 1 to 9 in each location, respectively, each separated by the number \u00e2\u20ac\u01531\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that stands as indicator label, forming thus the 72 time-series chemical sensor responses that is fetched to the classifier for training as described in the study.

However, they represent so called \"boundary\" values; according to these \"boundary\" values the attribute can be discretized.

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.

If they make a mistake or are unhappy with a character writing, they are instructed to clear the content of the corresponding box by using an on-screen button and try again. Subjects are monitored only when writing their first exemplars and every sample considered OK by its writer was accepted as such.\n Only X and Y coordinate information was recorded along the strokes by the acquisition program, without, for instance, pressure level values or timing information. Thus, in multi-stroke samples, no information at all was recorded between strokes; however, in this database version we have included a \".DT 100\" line in sample files after each stroke, following the Pendigits database criterion.\n We have observed that runs of consecutive points with identical coordinates were frequently acquired inside strokes; such runs were preserved in this database version, so each database user must decide whether to avoid them by an appropriate preprocessing step or not.", "attrInformation": "For each sample, you can find:\n a.

This dataset is an extension of the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset ([Web Link]), providing now the information about the concentration level at which the sensors were exposed for each measurement. The primary purpose of making this dataset freely accessible on-line is to provide an extensive dataset to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks, including sensor drift, classification, regression, among others. \n The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded. Citation of both Vergara et al. 'Chemical gas sensor drift compensation using classifier ensembles' and Rodriguez-Lujan et al. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the calibration of sensor arrays for pattern recognition using the minimal number of experiments\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is required (see below).\n The dataset was gathered during the period of January 2008 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors. See reference 1 for more details on the experimental setup. \n The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, dosed at a wide variety of concentration levels in the intervals (50,1000), (5,500), (12,1000), (10,300), (10,600), and (10,100) ppmv, respectively.", "attrInformation": "The responses of the said sensors are read in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor; hence, each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each  represented by an aggregate of features reflecting the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: (i) the so-called steady-state feature (DR), defined as the maximal resistance change with respect to the baseline and its DR normalized version (DR divided by the acquired value when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber). And (ii), an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement. This aggregate of features is a transformation, borrowed from the field of econometrics and originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the transient portion of the sensor response into a real scalar by estimating the maximum/minimum value y[k] for the rising/decaying portion of the exponential moving average of the sensor response:\n y[k] = (1-Alfa) y[k-1]+Alfa(R[k]-R[k-1])\n where R[k] is the sensor resistance measured at time k and Alfa is a scalar smoothing parameter between 0 and 1.\n In particular, three different values for Alfa=0.1, 0.01, 0.001 were set to obtain three different feature values from the rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same Alfa values for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. \n Thus, each feature vector contains the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor, resulting in a 128-dimensional feature vector (8 features x 16 sensors) containing all the features and organized as follows:\nDR_1, |DR|_1, EMAi0.001_1, EMAi0.01_1, EMAi0.1_1, EMAd0.001_1, EMAd0.01_1, EMAd0.1_1, DR_2, |DR|_2, EMAi0.001_2, EMAi0.01_2, EMAi0.1_2, EMAd0.001_2, EMAd0.01_2, EMAd0.1_2,..., DR_16, |DR|_16, EMAi0.001_16, EMAi0.01_16, EMAi0.1_16, EMAd0.001_16, EMAd0.01_16, EMAd0.1_16\nwhere: DR_j and |DR|_j are the R and the normalized R features, respectively. EMAi0.001_j, EMAi0.01_j, and EMAi0.1_j, are the emaR of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. EMAd0.001_j, EMAd0.01_j, and EMAd0.1_j, are emaR of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. The index j=1\u00e2\u20ac\u00a616 represents the number of the sensor, forming thus the 128-dimensional feature vector. \n For processing purposes, the dataset is organized into ten batches, each containing the number of measurements per class and month indicated in the tables below. This reorganization of data was done to ensure having a sufficient and as uniformly distributed as possible number of experiments in each batch. \n Batch ID\tMonth IDs \nBatch 1\t Months 1 and 2 \nBatch 2\t Months 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 \nBatch 3\t Months 11, 12, and 13 \nBatch 4\t Months 14 and 15 \nBatch 5\t Month 16 \nBatch 6\t Months 17, 18, 19, and 20 \nBatch 7\t Month 21 \nBatch 8\t Months 22 and 23 \nBatch 9\t Months 24 and 30 \nBatch 10 Month 36 \n Batch ID: Ethanol, Ethylene, Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Toluene\nBatch 1: 83, 30, 70, 98, 90, 74\nBatch 2: 100, 109, 532, 334, 164, 5\nBatch 3: 216, 240, 275, 490, 365, 0\nBatch 4: 12, 30, 12, 43, 64, 0\nBatch 5: 20, 46, 63, 40, 28, 0\nBatch 6: 110, 29, 606, 574, 514, 467\nBatch 7: 360, 744, 630, 662, 649, 568\nBatch 8: 40, 33, 143, 30, 30, 18\nBatch 9: 100, 75, 78, 55, 61, 101\nBatch 10: 600, 600, 600, 600, 600, 600 \n  The dataset is organized in files, each representing a different batch. Within the files, each line represents a measurement. The first character (1-6) codes the analyte, followed by the concentration level:\n 1: Ethanol; 2: Ethylene; 3: Ammonia; 4: Acetaldehyde; 5: Acetone; 6: Toluene\n The data format follows the same coding style as in libsvm format x:v, where x stands for the feature number and v for the actual value of the feature. For example, in \n1;10.000000 1:15596.162100 2:1.868245 3:2.371604 4:2.803678 5:7.512213 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 128:-2.654529 \n The number 1 stands for the class number (in this case Ethanol), the gas concentration level was 10ppmv, and the remaining 128 columns list the actual feature values for each measurement recording organized as described above.

Thus, being able to specify a location with strong influence on the music is central. \n The geographical location of origin was manually collected the information from the CD sleeve notes, and when this information was inadequate we searched other information sources. The location data is limited in precision to the country of origin.  \n The country of origin was determined by the artist's or artists' main country/area of residence.  Any track that had ambiguous origin is not included.  We have taken the position of each country's capital city (or the province of the area) by latitude and longitude as the absolute point of origin.\n The program MARSYAS[1] was used to extract audio features from the wave files. We used the default MARSYAS settings in single vector format (68 features) to estimate the performance with basic timbal information covering the entire length of each track. No feature weighting or pre-filtering was applied. All features were transformed to have a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1. We also investigated the utility of adding chromatic attributes. These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology.

Shimmer2 [BUR10] wearable sensors were used for the recordings. The sensors were respectively placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle and attached by using elastic straps (as shown in the figure in attachment). The use of multiple sensors permits us to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, the acceleration, the rate of turn and the magnetic field orientation, thus better capturing the body dynamics. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements which are not used for the development of the recognition model but rather collected for future work purposes. This information can be used, for example, for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. All sensing modalities are recorded at a sampling rate of 50 Hz, which is considered sufficient for capturing human activity. Each session was recorded using a video camera. This dataset is found to generalize to common activities of the daily living, given the diversity of body parts involved in each one (e.g., frontal elevation of arms vs. knees bending), the intensity of the actions (e.g., cycling vs. sitting and relaxing) and their execution speed or dynamicity (e.g., running vs. standing still). The activities were collected in an out-of-lab environment with no constraints on the way these must be executed, with the exception that the subject should try their best when executing them.\n ACTIVITY SET\nThe activity set is listed in the following:\nL1: Standing still (1 min) \nL2: Sitting and relaxing (1 min) \nL3: Lying down (1 min) \nL4: Walking (1 min) \nL5: Climbing stairs (1 min) \nL6: Waist bends forward (20x) \nL7: Frontal elevation of arms (20x)\nL8: Knees bending (crouching) (20x)\nL9: Cycling (1 min)\nL10: Jogging (1 min)\nL11: Running (1 min)\nL12: Jump front & back (20x)\nNOTE: In brackets are the number of repetitions (Nx) or the duration of the exercises (min).\n A complete and illustrated description (including table of activities, sensor setup, etc.) of the dataset is provided in the papers presented in the section \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citation Requests\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n", "attrInformation": "The data collected for each subject is stored in a different log file: 'mHealth_subject.log'.

The documents were assembled and indexed with categories by personnel from Reuters Ltd. (Sam Dobbins, Mike Topliss, Steve Weinstein) and Carnegie Group, Inc. (Peggy Andersen, Monica Cellio, Phil Hayes, Laura Knecht, Irene Nirenburg) in 1987.  \n In 1990, the documents were made available by Reuters and CGI for research purposes to the Information Retrieval Laboratory (W.  Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Formatting of the documents and production of associated data files was done in 1990 by David D.  Lewis and Stephen Harding at the Information Retrieval Laboratory.\n Further formatting and data file production was done in 1991 and 1992 by David D. Lewis and Peter Shoemaker at the Center for Information and Language Studies, University of Chicago.  This version of the data was made available for anonymous FTP as \"Reuters-22173, Distribution 1.0\" in January 1993. From 1993 through 1996, Distribution 1.0 was hosted at a succession of FTP sites maintained by the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (W. Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n At the ACM SIGIR '96 conference in August, 1996 a group of text categorization researchers discussed how published results on Reuters-22173 could be made more comparable across studies.  It was decided that a new version of collection should be produced with less ambiguous formatting, and including documentation carefully spelling out standard methods of using the collection.  The opportunity would also be used to correct a variety of typographical and other errors in the categorization and formatting of the collection.\n Steve Finch and David D. Lewis did this cleanup of the collection September through November of 1996, relying heavily on Finch's SGML-tagged version of the collection from an earlier study.  One result of the re-examination of the collection was the removal of 595 documents which were exact duplicates (based on identity of timestamps down to the second) of other documents in the collection. The new collection therefore has only 21,578 documents, and thus is called the Reuters-21578 collection.

Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.\n The data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.\n Due to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy. \n This dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.\n In previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.\n A mirror of the dataset may currently be obtained at [Web Link] by following the Postures link.", "attrInformation": "Data is provided as a CSV file.

Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised \nby sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of \nconstant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. \nTemperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted \nurine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually \nwithin several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute \ninflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into \nprotracted form.\n Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at \nmen. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever \nis accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very \nstrong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not \ninfrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.\n The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which \nwill perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system.

A bag is set to have a particular class label if and only if at least one of its instances has that class label.\n DeliciousMIL consists of a subset of tagged web pages from the social bookmarking site delicious.com. The original web pages were obtained from DeliciousT140 dataset, which was collected by [2] from the delicious.com in June 2008. Users of the website delicious.com bookmarked each page with word tags. From this dataset, we extracted text parts of each web page and chose 20 common tags as class labels. These class labels are:\nreference, design, programming, internet, computer, web, java, writing, English, grammar, style, language, books, education, philosophy, politics, religion, science, history, and culture.\n We randomly selected 12234 pages and randomly divided them into 8251 training and 3983 test documents. We also applied Porter stemming and standard stopword removal. \n Each text document is a bag within a multi-instance learning framework consisting of multiple sentences (instances). The goal is to predict document-level and sentence-level class labels on the test set using a model which is trained given only the document-level class labels in the training set.\nTo evaluate performance of such a model, we have manually labeled 1468 randomly selected sentences from the test documents.

You can use the data from Monday to invest on Tuesday.  \n In our research each record (row) is data for a week.  Each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week (percent_change_next_weeks_price). Ideally, you want to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week.  This can help you train and test your algorithm.\n Some of these attributes might not be use used in your research.  They were originally added to our database to perform calculations.  (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) used percent_change_price, percent_change_volume_over_last_wk, days_to_next_dividend, and percent_return_next_dividend.

The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.\n We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. \n These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. \n In our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  \n In order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.\n So, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.", "attrInformation": "All input attributes are integers in the range 0..100.\nThe last attribute is the class code 0..9", "image": null}, {"link": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2", "datasetFolder": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00372/", "datasetDescription": "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2#", "title": "HTRU2 Data Set", "dsFeatures": "Multivariate", "numberObs": "17898", "area": "Physical", "atributeType": "Real", "numberAttr": "9", "dateDonated": "2017-02-14", "missingValues": "N/A", "numberWebHits": "33963", "abstract": "Pulsar candidates collected during the HTRU survey.

They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). \n As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars\nrotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.\n Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.\n Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,\n(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.\n The data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. \n The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).\n Please note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]).", "attrInformation": "Each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables, and a single class variable.

However, not all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring system. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case that useful information is buried in the latter two. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. If we consider each type of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.\n To enhance current business improvement techniques the application of feature selection as an intelligent systems technique is being investigated.\n The dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing, figure 2, and associated date time stamp. Where \u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 corresponds to a pass and 1 corresponds to a fail and the data time stamp is for that specific test point.\n  Using feature selection techniques it is desired to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product, causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features.\n Results may be submitted in terms of feature relevance for predictability using error rates as our evaluation metrics. It is suggested that cross validation be applied to generate these results. Some baseline results are shown below for basic feature selection techniques using a simple kernel ridge classifier and 10 fold cross validation.\n Baseline Results: Pre-processing objects were applied to the dataset simply to standardize the data and remove the constant features and then a number of different feature selection objects selecting 40 highest ranked features were applied with a simple classifier to achieve some initial results. 10 fold cross validation was used and the balanced error rate (*BER) generated as our initial performance metric to help investigate this dataset.\n  SECOM Dataset: 1567 examples 591 features, 104 fails\n FSmethod (40 features) BER % True + % True - %\nS2N (signal to noise) 34.5 +-2.6 57.8 +-5.3 73.1 +2.1\nTtest 33.7 +-2.1 59.6 +-4.7 73.0 +-1.8\nRelief 40.1 +-2.8 48.3 +-5.9 71.6 +-3.2\nPearson 34.1 +-2.0 57.4 +-4.3 74.4 +-4.9\nFtest 33.5 +-2.2 59.1 +-4.8 73.8 +-1.8\nGram Schmidt 35.6 +-2.4 51.2 +-11.8 77.5 +-2.3", "attrInformation": "Key facts: Data Structure: The data consists of 2 files the dataset file SECOM consisting of 1567 examples each with 591 features a 1567 x 591 matrix and a labels file containing the classifications and date time stamp for each example. \n As with any real life data situations this data contains null values varying in intensity depending on the individuals features.

The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN.\n The original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually.\n Subsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing, say, if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC.\n The entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated.\n Detailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html. \n Missing Values:\n Outside of key fields, missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete.\n Censored Data:\n Minor actors are ignored.\n Dependencies:\n Every MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information.\n Other Relevant Information:\n Films are listed, if known, with their original language title.

It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation.

The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\n The hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:\n  NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools\n .

The 6th run is a \"drill\" run, where users execute a scripted sequence of activities. \n  * Annotations/classes: the activities of the user in the scenario are annotated on different levels: \"modes of locomotion\" classes; low-level actions relating 13 actions to 23 objects; 17 mid-level gesture classes; and 5 high-level activity classes\n ** Recording scenario **\n The activity recognition environment and scenario has been designed to generate many activity primitives, yet in a realistic manner. Subjects operated in a room simulating a studio flat with a deckchair, a kitchen, doors giving access to the outside, a coffee machine, a table and a chair.\n We achieved a natural execution of activities by instructing users to follow a high-level script but leaving them free interpretation as how to achieve the high-level goals. We furthermore encouraged them to perform as naturally as possible with all the variations they were used to.\n For each subject we recorded 6 different runs. Five of them, termed activity of daily living (ADL), followed a given scenario as detailed below. The remaining one, a drill run, was designed to generate a large number of activity instances. The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations. In each situation (e.g. preparing sandwich), a large number of action primitives occur (e.g. reach for bread, move to bread cutter, operate bread cutter).\n * ADL run *\n The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations:\n     Start: lying on the deckchair, get up\n    Groom: move in the room, check that all the objects are in the right places in the drawers and on shelves\n    Relax: go outside and have a walk around the building\n    Prepare coffee: prepare a coffee with milk and sugar using the coffee machine\n    Drink coffee: take coffee sips, move around in the environment\n    Prepare sandwich: include bread, cheese and salami, using the bread cutter and various knifes and plates\n    Eat sandwich\n    Cleanup: put objects used to original place or dish washer, cleanup the table\n    Break: lie on the deckchair\n * Drill run *\n The drill run consists of 20 repetitions of the following sequence of activities:\n     Open then close the fridge\n    Open then close the dishwasher\n    Open then close 3 drawers (at different heights)\n    Open then close door 1\n    Open then close door 2\n    Toggle the lights on then off\n    Clean the table\n    Drink while standing\n    Drink while seated\n ** Annotations **\n The annotations are done on five \u00c2\u2018tracks\u00c2\u2019. One track contains modes of locomotion (e.g. sitting, standing, walking). Two other tracks indicate the actions of the left and right hand (e.g. reach, grasp, release), and to which object they apply (e.g. milk, switch, door).\nThe fourth track indicates the high level activities (e.g. prepare sandwich). The high level activities relate to the situations indicated in the description of the ADL runs as follows (in parenthesis the number of the situations indicated above): relaxing (1, 9), early morning (2, 3), coffee time (4, 5), sandwich time (6, 7), cleanup (8).\n The mid-level gesture annotations is generated automatically from the low-level hand actions. It comprises coarser characterization of the user's activities. For instance the low-level annotations 'reach door' and 'open door' are combined into a single 'open door' mid-level annotation. Here, the mid-level annotations comprise actions of the left and right hand indiscriminately. However, in practice, the users mostly interacted with the environment with their right hand. We recommend to use the mid-level annotations in first attempts to use this dataset.\n ** Applications **\n This dataset offers a rich playground to assess methods such as, e.g:\n   * Classification, (semi-) supervised machine learning\n  * Automatic segmentation\n  * Unsupervised structure discovery\n  * Data imputation\n  * Multi-modal sensor fusion\n  * Sensor network research\n  * Transfer learning, multitask learning\n  * Sensor selection\n  * Feature extraction\n  * Classifier calibration and adaptation\n  * ...\n ** Baseline benchmarks **\n Baseline benchmarks for the OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge subset of the dataset are available in reference [2].

Data has been collected during user movements at the frequency of 8 Hz (8 samples per second). In the provided dataset, the RSS signals have been rescaled to the interval [-1,1], singly on the set of traces collected from each anchor (as in [1]).\nTarget data consists in a class label indicating whether the user's trajectory will lead to a change in the spatial context (i.e. a room change) or not. In particular, the target class +1 is associated to the location changing movements, while the target class -1 is associated to the location preserving movements.\nThe measurement campaign involved a number of 3 different environmental settings, each of which comprises 2 rooms (containing typical office furniture) separated by a corridor. A sketch of the common setup considered is provided in the attached Figure. In each environmental setting, the anchors are deployed in fixed positions near the rooms corners (at the height of 1.5 m from the ground), while the mobile is worn on the chest of the user. The Figure also shows a simplified illustration of the types of user trajectories considered, with straight paths yielding to a spatial context change and curved ones leading to spatial context preservation. Each path produces a trace of RSS measurements from the beginning of the trajectory until a marker point, which is denoted as M in the Figure. The marker M is the same for all the movements, therefore different paths cannot be distinguished based only on the RSS values collected at M.\n Each input file in the provided dataset contains data pertaining to one temporal sequence of input RSS data (1 user trajectory for each file). The dataset contains 314 sequences, for a total number of 13197 steps.\n Further information can be found at the webpage: [Web Link].\nA complete description of this dataset can be found in [1], which also provides details on the performance achieved by Echo State Networks on the corresponding classification task.\n", "attrInformation": "Data is provided in comma separated value (csv) format. \n - Input data\nInput RSS streams are provided in files named MovementAAL_RSS_SEQID.csv, where IDSEQ is the progressive numeric sequence ID.\nIn each file, each row corresponds to a time step measurement (in temporal order) and contains the following information:\nRSS_anchor1, RSS_anchor2, RSS_anchor3, RSS_anchor4 \n - Target data\nTarget data is provided in the file MovementAAL_target.csv\nEach row in this file contains:\nsequence_ID, class_label\n  - Dataset grouping\nData is grouped in 3 sets, as described in [1].\nFile MovementAAL_DatasetGroup.csv, provides information about such data grouping.\nEach row in this file contains:\nsequence_ID, dataset_ID\n - Path grouping\nUsers' movements are divided in 6 prototypical paths, as described in [1].\nFile MovementAAL_Paths.csv provides information about data grouping based on path type.\nEach row in this file contains:\nsequence_ID, path_ID", "image": null}]}
